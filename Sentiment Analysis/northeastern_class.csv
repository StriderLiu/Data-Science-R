Review: 41 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"October 18, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I ordered Echo specifically for music - Ive had a huge music library on Amazon for years. But it didnt take long after installing Echo to find out that there is now an annual charge for having over 250 songs, so only a small portion of my library is available. But OK - since subscription is to be expected these days, I decided to pare down my library down to fit and get Echo to play only the songs that are free. But I found Alexa will not play them. When I ask to play something from my music library, it plays unfamiliar songs that I know are not in there. If I ask for one of my playlists instead, more often than not shell just start playing crappy Prime music. When that happens, I just keep saying Alexa, next until maybe 7 tunes later, it produces something I can actually tolerate. Another 7 or so crappy tunes, and my blood pressure is rising, so I figure its too much work to listen to any more music on Echo. I say Alexa, stop. When I ask for a specific song, I might get it to play because its actually in Prime (Ive been a Prime shipping member since the beginning). But more often, I will get a pitch for the Unlimited music at $8 per month, and a short sample of the song I wanted to hear to try to upsell me to an expensive service I dont want. Ive found that all of the Prime services are quite limited not only Music, but Video and Books. Its especially hard to find anything of any real value in Books - mostly its stupid romances and mysteries. Video has a similar low ratio of classics to dreck. Now I've discovered the same problem exists in Prime Music. And compared to Prime services, Google Play and Google Search are a pleasure. They have enough good content that I use them at work constantly. I was expecting something similar for my home from Amazon. But back to Echo. Another battle I had with Alexa was that I assumed she could hear me at all. Its quiet in my small house, and my office is just down the hall from her, but often I got no response to my voice commands. So I figured Ill try using the Fire TV remote device to feed in my commands directly. I bought Fire TV initially because of the suggestion somewhere on the web site that it would work with Echo, which I planned to buy later (I dont particularly like Fire TV, but at least it wasnt expensive.) I could see from the Alexa app how to do the pairing, but had no luck, so I called Support. After a while I was told I have to un-pair it for TV and set it to work for the Echo instead, so we spent about an hour trying to do that over and over without success. I wouldnt mind switching pairing back and forth if it would work, so I gave it my best shot. Finally I got escalated to the Echo team and learned from that team member that the Fire TV remote will never work. Instead I have to buy a remote that is specifically for Echo. Already I wasted hours on several support calls trying to get Echo to play my music library, then another hour trying to get the Fire TV remote to work, and finally I learned it would cost me another $30 to get Alexa to hear me if Im in my office, only about 12 feet away. What a waste for something that shouldnt be necessary in the first place. As for troubleshooting the music library, several very nice Support team members tried to help me get it to upload. I first got a rep who says shed give me a 30-day trial to verify that it would work before I subscribed. So I spent a couple of days editing my copy of my library (on an extended drive) so I could try dragging them into Amazons Musics desktop app to upload them. But then, the upload from my desktop would not work. Instead I got an email that the trial had already expired -- in two days instead of thirty. Another rep tried to get the trial going, but I got another two-day expiration (I do have other things to do, so I wasnt working on it during those two days). So again, uploading my meager library did not work. I even got a third expired trial, but by then I was past caring. Actually, all of the support reps are very earnest, charming, polite, and accommodating, but they seem to have a very small knowledge base to work with. There is no documentation available to them, much less customers, so they have to guess thats probably why it took forever to find out the Fire TV remote wouldnt work. The 30-day trials didnt work either, but it made sense that there would be a way to accommodate customers who do want to give it a chance before investing heavily in the necessary upsells. I guess upper management didnt think of that. As noted by other Echo reviewers, the bugs are apparently not yet worked out, and it seems to me that the support process has apparently been defined only for garden-variety issues. I get the feeling that this product was just released too early, and the customer service process was not coordinated with the release to deal with the inevitable problems customers would have with Echo. I hope Amazon will learn from this review and fix these problems for others, but its too late for me. While going through all of these remarkable hassles, I was constantly re-evaluating my commitment to this device. I was deciding whether to spend up to $235 for what is essentially just a voice-activated speaker - $180 plus $25 for the subscription, $30 for an additional remote. But the other services are marginal at best. As in the other reviews here, I found that Alexa knows practically nothing (Bing search engine?), so getting questions answered successfully is rare. Alexa does set a timer and reports the weather competently, but I have an iPhone, so why would I care about those small conveniences? All I really wanted was voice-activated music. If I ever had gotten my library in there on a trial basis, Id probably have gone ahead and used it maybe even paid for a subscription, though certainly not Unlimited music. But Amazons trial software doesnt work yet to show me that my music library would ever work, so why should I keep banging my head on the wall trying force Echo to work as advertised? Recently, I learned that Google is releasing a competitive device in a couple of weeks, and the online review says I can easily upload my music library to it and use Google Play and Search instead. Plus its going to be about half the price of Echo, and considering all the upsells needed to make Echo work, it seems like a no-brainer to just give up on Alexa and Echo. So sorry, Amazon, I love you -- Im one of your oldest customers, and have probably spent over $100,000 on your site since 2000. But this product has become a paperweight that I don't even try to use anymore. Im sorry to say that its time to throw in the towel and just send it back.",null,null,,null

Alexa tells jokes, reports the weather local and abroad, shares current events, plays music (you can hook her up to your iTunes account for a small fee but we decided it wasn't necessary because it was easier to connect her to our free Pandora account instead), and creates a shopping list (all voice activated so much more efficient than pulling out your phone and typing)! Set up was very easy - just download the free Amazon Alexa app and follow the instructions. I didn't realize the shopping list would go directly to the app on my phone! The app also keeps a running newsfeed of what you've recently asked Alexa - we like this because our kids LOVE her and we can quickly glance at what they asked her in case it was inappropriate (however, she doesn't seem to answer inappropriate questions anyway). We asked her a dirty joke and she told us a farm animal joke about mud! Lol! :) We keep in our kitchen so she's easily accessible. Excellent, user friendly technology!",null,null,,null
Review: 190 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"March 28, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I've had the Echo for just under a year now and I've used a lot of features on it. It's not as flawless as the commercial, naturally. It plays music great. A simple voice command, ""Alexa, play pop music on prime"" and it will answer you back with an acknowledgement to your request then begin the task. It takes some discipline for the kids when they hear the station they don't want not to shout out ""ALEXA!"" in an attempt to sabotage your brief moment of serenity. I did find that the extra features like traffic, news and weather weren't the best source of information. It was often times difficult to actually get Alexa to tell me what I wanted to hear. I'm not talking about clearing the roadways, I'm talking about giving me the right information. I enjoy the Echo because I got it for the simplicity of playing music without having to connect my music player, or leave my phone docked somewhere. The sound quality is very good in my opinion and the volume can get too loud for a house at level 10. You'd have to walk over to the Echo and turn it down by hand because Alexa won't hear you. We stick to volume 5 or below and it's served us well. I'd call it a great radio with a wide range of music sources. We enjoy it and we recommend it!",null,null,,null

She has gotten into base jumping. She did it a couple of times and was successful so I think it just went to her head. I guess when you are an inanimate object with a super powered brain and you are forced to stand around all day, the wind in your cracks and holes would feel invigorating and maybe even dislodge some dust. Well. . . unfortunately she decided to try the big jump recently and we found out that Alexas, unlike cats, dont always land on their feet. She wasnt the same after that jump. I think she had a screw loose. She started to flip her top. Well, one more short jump and Alexas lights have dimmed. She is currently in a medically induced coma and I dont think anything short of a soddering iron and super glue is going to fix her. Alexa just stood too tall and got knocked over too easy. When she fell she almost always rolled right for those cliff faces. In the future, I think a squattier non rolling Alexa is going to be the right move for families with small kids. Or maybe the new Alexa babies that you hook to your own speakers will be less inclined to be knocked over.",null,null,,null
Review: 85 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Dec 06 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 6, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I have owned and used this for 6 months now before writing this review - I wanted to make sure that everything I write on here remained accurate to the best of my ability. Pros: Unique product with a plethora of wonderful and completely unique combinations of capabilities. -fast response time -once you learn how to ask certain things and read the instructions of each major update, you find yourself using it without even thinking. I even use it to dress myself occasionally - like asking for different ways to tie a bow tie (since I normally wear a standard tie lol) -flash briefing while getting ready to go to morning meetings and business briefings is a phenomenal time saver (with no strain on the eyes!) -each update (all auto updates) really adds a lot of function and prime continues to add so much more functionality every month. I no longer use Spotify. Prime music lets me import the music I already own and use their massive library as well. (Which can be hilariously strange, I will admit, as they somehow do not have The Beatles - no I am not joking - but they have over half of the obscure punk bands I grew up loving decades ago). -Alexa learns quite a lot of subtle things. If I say her name in a sentence now (this took a few months) she will not respond unnecessarily. However, if I open with ""Alexa"" she will always respond. I still get the occasional unwanted response from her, but she has never once failed to respond when I called her. -I avoid so many arguments with my wife now because of Alexa's shopping list function and the iOS/android app -- also, the built in To-Do lists. Happy wife happy life. Enough said. -tech wise: the speaker on the Echo is phenomenal. It sounds better than the 50"" Vizio Soundbar that's mounted to the tv in our home office. The 360degree sound and deep bass is SO good for any genre of music. You don't get any peakage or distortion, no matter how heavy the bass or how high the treble - also mids are completely clear, audible and articulate. I could not be happier with the sound quality. -smart home integration is superb if you buy the other items after Echo (to ensure compatibility) Cons: -while this item has Bluetooth capabilities, they have been very unnecessarily and frustratingly limited (because I assume they think that following the business model of Microsoft and Mac to make frustrating proprietary crap in the worst possible ways is a smart idea -- it's not). If I could integrate this with other Bluetooth devices aside from the phones that are running Alexa App and the Amazon Prime Music App - this device would literally be perfect. For example, being able to use Bluetooth stereo headphones/mic while I'm in the office, or even a remote Bluetooth speaker for another room. They tried with their remote to at least do SOMETHING, but it's always out of stock and it really should be included with the base unit - even if it makes the price 199.99 instead of 179. Also, as someone who is a huge technophile, does pretty much all of my computing from a terminal emulator, the fact that Amazon had support for Linux with their Prime Music and other apps for so long - and has now REMOVED that support - absolutely infuriates me. Open source is the future, it doesn't matter how many decades the old men (Gates and co.) try to drag their heels...",null,null,,null

In most things I've asked of Alexa I am happy, pleased, and even promote it to others. I like the features like tell me the time, or when to the Seahawks play football this week, or wake me in 15 minutes; however, I am a big reader and was delighted to imagine it might read my most recent book while I'm doing dishes, etc. Tried it, and stopped within 5 minutes. She reads a bit too fast, with wooden voice inflections. When she sees ""why"" she assumes it is a question even if the context is not a question. Yuk! Not doing that ever again. I'll have Audio.com read my books to me through my iPhone with ear buds. Awkward with the wires, but oh well, much more enjoyable.",null,null,,null
Review: 429 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Aug 25 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"August 25, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Let's just start by saying that I love Echo (aka Alexa). This is the first step towards a fully connected home. Sure, for now she's great for things like playing the radio (""Alexa, play WXPN radio""), news updates, or for cooking timers and various alarms. I rarely use the to-do list feature and never user the shopping lists, but who cares about those anyway. I want to be able to say ""Alexa, turn off the office lights"" and have her do just that; and I know that's possible with some new connected wall switches. Where I think the real power of this device will eventually show up is with deeper home automation. I'd really love to be able to do the following: * Alexa, Turn on the TV * Alexa, Mute the TV * Alexa, Change TV to Roku * Alexa, Change TV to DVD * Alexa, Pause the TV (and have it know whether I'm watching TiVo, Roku or my DVD player) * Alexa, Water the Garden for 1 hour * Alexa, Make me Dinner (OK, maybe that's asking too much, but not after watching Humans) Hopefully more app and device developers will step in to build hooks for connected devices (including IR blasters) so that we can really use Alexa as our the main hub in an automated home.",null,null,,null

It is simply not ready for prime time right now. I will gladly change my review in time, but it needs tighter integration with ""Search"", it needs to let developers add plug-ins for it so it can integrate with more of what is on my phone and what is on the web. Too many times Alexa replies ""Hmmm, I don't think I understand"" or ""I can't find the answer to that"", it becomes unreliable and moves from being a go-to device. So basically right now, the kids ask it jokes, I add things to my grocery list, listen to a little music and once and a while set a timer.",null,null,,null

Review: 354 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 21, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"The Echo is fast. Damn fast! It can even pull up music from Pandora and iHeart Radio in less than 5 seconds! It recognizes my voice in a near- whisper from 20 feet away! It even finds artists and albums with a few short words! ""Shuffling [so-and-so] by [so-and-so]."". Boom! 2 seconds, you're listening to a new album or artist you DON'T have in your prime collection! I want to listen to anything... Well here you go. The only catch is you have to know what you're looking for. If you don't get it right, the Echo might ask you if you're looking for [this]. For me, I needed the ability to listen to my hundreds of albums on Google Music. But guess what? Anything not on your stations in Pandora, iHeart Radio or on Prime Music... It's a friggin Bluetooth speaker! It will stream music from my phone or tablet. Set the volume by asking for volume 1 to impressively loud 10! Very soothing voice (like a female version of Jarvis from Iron Man), fluid natural speaking, a pretty fun library of jokes ( I tried the woodchuck joke, it responded funny the first time), the abily to pause, resume, and repeat any incoming Bluetooth music... Wow. Why did Google not get all over this? Maybe they did. You know Google. But it suggests a Bing search it sends to your device. It's obvious who endorsed this. It is the beginning of Skynet. Ha ha ha. It can control any WiFi device such as lights. If I were to reach for a complaint (far reach!), it doesn't have a function to shuffle your own playlists. You can ask for it when music begins. But I'm huge on Shuffle. It will instead start on the same piece every time. And no Reapeat-All fuction. It instead starts over the playlist when asked. Maybe the functions are somewhere burried in the Alexa App. The last thing I could say, it's very simple for some responses and no ability to follow up the previous question.

Review: 394 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"April 25, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"The Amazon Echo is a very good product. It has the potential to eventually be a great product. Anyone reading this review will likely already know about most, if not all, of the Echo's features so I will not clutter this review with descriptions of the basic features. I do want to share an observation about Echo's integration with IFTTT. The Amazon Alexa IFTTT library of recipes is still small. Hopefully more recipes will be coming soon. And, as many other Echo owners have stated, the current way of issuing Alexa IFTTT commands is mostly awkward. For example, if you want Alexa to call someone's cell phone (or your own) there are some recipes to do that. However, most of those recipes work by telling Alexa to add an item to your to-do list. That is awkward, and can create confusion for elderly users of the Echo. Another somewhat annoying aspect of the Alexa IFTTT arrangement is that in order to activate an IFTTT recipes it is necessary to preface the recipe name with the command ""TRIGGER"". For example, I have a recipe that I created for possible use by my elderly mom. The recipe is ""Call Jerry"" (it sends a saved message). So, for my mom to ask Alexa to call me, she would need to say ""Alexa, Trigger Call Jerry"". Her brain at her age does not think like that. At the very least, I strongly suggest that Amazon change the IFTTT activation word ""TRIGGER"" to ""PLEASE"". This will make for more natural sounding commands. My previous ""Call Jerry"" example would become: ""Alexa, Please Call Jerry"" -- that sounds very natural, and probably can be remembered better by not only elderly people, but everyone. If the Amazon Echo is to go beyond ""very good"" to ""great"" Amazon and IFTTT would need to make it possible for more natural language statements to accomplish tasks and recipes. As it stands now, the Echo implements a rather limited syntax. Until then, I think my suggestion to use ""PLEASE"" instead of (or optionally to) ""TRIGGER"" would be a good interim solution.",null,null,,null
Review: 192 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Nov 29 00:00:00 EST 2015,"November 29, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,See this is why I wish Amazon had half star reviews as well. Because I love it! But there are a few set back on it. But its not a four star product nor is it a 5 star. Of course this is a new item and there are a few kinks and ripples in its operation. But thats to be expected from a voice guided system. I mean Siri wasn't that great when they first put it on their iPhones. But now look what it can do. You can ask it all sorts of questions and it will answer most of the time. But sometimes it has a hard time getting an answer. I know it understands me well enough because when you open up the app on your phone you can see that it clearly heard you and understood what you were saying it just didn't have the answer for you in the cloud. But one thing Amazon did do right are the multi-colored lights at the top of the speaker thats a REALLY cool additive. They also made it wired to a power source which is a good think because if it had a battery it would probably have to be 12 times bigger and 6 times heavier than it is now. But as Amazon and its services comes up with new updates and new things to add to the features it will get way more better over time. But there are a few down sides. Sometimes when I'm playing some music off of my phone through bluetooth it gets kinda glitchy and lags a few second every now and then. Then theres the fact that when you turn the volume up too loud it will start to distort the speaker and it will sound very raspy and poor. I know Amazon can fix all these things with a few software updates or building their online knowledge database. But until then it a 4.5 for me.,null,null,,null

This product feels like the ""next big thing"" and Amazon just gave Apple a black eye. That out of the way I love everything about this device. It's sound quality is almost mind blowing and Alexa is fairly quick on the draw with answers or looking up music. Like Siri she's a little rough around the edges on some subjects. She had no idea who the Texas Rangers baseball team are but she knew how old Burt Reynolds is in a split second. Go figure. Weather forecasts and other things you might ask on a daily basis seem to be absolutely no challenge and she gives quick succinct answers. The only thing lacking is any kind of visual interface so you have to ask Alexa for any information you might want like the name of a song. I'm actually using my iPhone and Siri to name the songs.

I want to begin by saying that when Amazon doesn't get it right, I'm very willing to write a negative review. But with this device, Amazon got it right. It must be said that this device is great for those who have bought music from Amazon Prime and books from Audible (an Amazon company). Like Apple's and Google's products, Echo is designed to maximize purchases from Amazon. Is that a bad thing? For me, not at all because I buy music and video from all three services. With that said, Echo is easy to set up and fun to use. So far I've asked Alexa to play NPR news, music from my Prime library, and asked her all kinds of information questions, most of which she could answer. The speaker's audio quality is very, very good and the volume can be adjusted surprisingly high with little to no distortion. My daughter and I were listening to music through Echo and playing ping pong two rooms away and the volume was loud enough that often we would have to repeat what we said to make ourselves heard. I can see our family using this mostly in the kitchen which is centrally located and where we spend a lot of time.

Hear the weather and the news flash from NPR. Play playlists from Amazon prime and radio stations from I Heart Radio. Thats good. There needs to be more refinement though. There's scant documentation on how it all works. You just have to figure it out as you go that this all works through linked accounts. One of the main things I bought this for is her to be able to listen to books on Audible. That works well except there are no features to go back a chapter, start reading over from the start of a chapter, or start reading from the beginning of the book. Alexa recognizes these commands but says something like sorry but you need to do that on the app. If the command is able to be recognized, Alexa should be able to start the book over at that point.

She told me that I wasted my $. After 60 days of use, we both have decided we can't live without this little gem. We use it daily. We probably don't use it to it's full potential, but here's what we mainly use it for: - Music streaming: We have a Bose Sound Dock, and that thing is now sitting and gathering dust. We are constantly streaming music off of Prime and Pandora. Who needs to bother with docking an iPod in the Bose and playing only whats on your playlists? Music quality isn't as good as on the Bose, but I'm not trying to have a rock concert. At low-medium volume levels, the sound is great. - Shopping and to-do lists: We are constantly making shopping and to-do lists with this thing. It works great. I don't like that you can only add one thing at a time to your lists, but I understand why they haven't fixed this yet. If I were to say ""Echo (that's the name of ours) add macaroni and cheese"" it will add mac and cheese to our list. If I were to say ""add steak and eggs and laundry detergent"" it doesn't differentiate the ""ands"" and it adds all of those on one line.

Review: 1 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"July 24, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"LOVE OUR NEW ECHO! I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion. I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the Helpful button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!",null,null,,null

My grandkids came to visit and spent the day driving me crazy by even asking her to do weird things. Did you know Alexa can make, fart noises if asked in the right way? No, - me either. Not something I need, but it does entertain little kids. I have found music I have never heard and listen to podcasts all the time. It is easy to set up and use - basically works itself. I had thought of buying speakers for my music, but in my small work room Alexa is great. Next question is do I really need the Tap or the Dot? Alexa can also turn on the lights, the temperature and works with Amazon Fire (which I have not yet used) I would definitely buy the Echo again.",null,null,,null

Pros - Great Product - Integrates with the Wink APP perfectly - You can control the Echo via voice using a Fujikam FI-361. More of an Easter egg than a feature. - Speaker sound is good, but it would be great if it had a little more bass. Maybe the next version of echo would include a BEATs speaker? Cons - It would be great if Echo would provide local movie times. Since its already pulling location information. It would be great if it would ask you what radius would you like to search or even better what theater you would like to visit. - I wish there was a way to disable the log feature. - I would also like to have a web GUI interface via PC in addition to my smart phone. - I would also like an easier way to pull the MAC address for those of us who are using MAC filtering on our wireless routers. You currently have to reach out to customer support to pull this information. That is a bit much don't you think? A label could eliminate a phone call or an email. Other thoughts: - It would be great if Echo would integrate with the BIBLE.is app. - It would be awesome if you could get a discount on the remote if you purchase an Echo. -02.02.16= Amazon added the local movie times feature to the Echo!

I've only had mine for a few days, but I'm already so used to having Alexa answer me that I've actually caught myself starting to talk to other household appliances just out of habit. The interface with Prime music is pretty good, if a bit quirky until you get used to it, and the sound quality is pretty good for the size and cost of the device. The shopping list and to-do lists work really well. For me, the coolest thing about Alexa isn't what she can do now, since that is fairly limited, but the promise of what she and other smart devices will be able to do soon. Some things Echo doesn't do now which I wish it would (or at least which I haven't figured out yet): -Let the user change the name to something other than Alexa or Amazon. No offense to anyone named Alexa, but it would be nice to be able to personalize it, and it would make sense for each user to have a different name for the device so there would be no question which profile the Echo uses. -Interface with other home electronics. As mentioned above, the sound quality of the Echo is pretty good, but it would sound much better if it could play music over my home stereo. -It would be really cool if the Echo would act as a speaker phone for my cell phone. -Shopping lists and to-do lists should be able to be emailed or printed so I don't have to sit staring at the Alexa app in the grocery store.",null,null,,null

My husband has lived here all his life, and still, he gets frustrated with it. So, when using it with our Hue lights, it usually takes several attempts to do it and often, especially when I am in a rush to drive my kids to school in the morning, I end up using old damp wall switch. My husband thinks that Echo messes up with our Wink system, so he had to disconnect them. As some of the reviewers have mentioned, it is useless for directions. If I have to write down every time my points A and B, I can easily do it in Google maps or on my GPS. And make sure to watch your shopping list. One time, I was listening to a program where one of the characters names was Alexa. To my surprise, I found a lot of stuff they mentioned in the program after calling her placed in my shopping list.

I am an iOS developer and very much an Apple fanboy. My relationship with Apple products isn't at all about Apple as a company. It is about the fact that most Apple products just work. The Mac is the best PC on the market and has been for years. The iPhone (for me) is the best phone on the market. I was totally hoping that HomeKit would be the solution that would finally give me what I have wanted since watching Star Trek back in the 70's. Amazon has beat EVERYONE to the race to the smart home appliance. The Echo is just fantastic. In just 5 days, it has transformed the way I thought about the smart home. My whole family loves it and it gets used throughout the day for all kinds of things. After day 1, we bought some GE Wink lights and ordered a Scout alarm system. A Nest and more Wink lights are also on the way. So far, this is what Alexa has done for us: 1. Play all kinds of music, playlists and genre shuffling 2. Handle all kinds of timers and alarms (cooking timers while your hands are all greasy is fantastic!) 3. Totally transformed our shopping lists. No more text messages for requesting stuff from the store 4. Tells us jokes (some are really good) 5. Audible audiobooks! 6. Turn lights on and off, the grouping of lights is awesome! 7. Checking calendar 8. News via flash briefing and iHeartradio 9. Weather updates! 10. Keeping track of ToDo's The IFTTT integration also opens up the Echo to do some really cool things for other un-related services. I am looking forward to August Smart Lock integration as well as expansion of capabilities (would be nice to change the wake word). What would make this absolutely awesome would be the addition of small BT connected mini-echo's that could be plugged directly into wall outlets or mounted on a wall. These could be placed in other rooms and stream playing music, alarms, timers, etc as well as act as remote microphones for the master Echo.",null,null,,null

As vision fades, reading is harder for her; as short term memory and attention fades, television becomes difficult; music from her youth seems to provide relief, allows her to sing along (although she can't remember names or relationships, the words to songs of her youth flow!), and can be a wonderful escape from trying to figure out who she is, where she is, and how to get ""home."" By making Prime playlists of songs from her youth whoever is providing care, family or professional caregiver, can easily and simply request the right song or playlist for the moment in order to sooth, redirect, or distract Mom.

When I looked on the web, I saw that this was an issue others faced, but there seemed to be no solutions. Thus, I called Amazon.

We were in the market for a new general use sound system already, and in that respect Echo does not disappoint. Besides the buyer's high when first unpacking my new toy (the packaging is Amazon's standard amazing fare), the first thing we noted after getting her up and running was the excellent sound quality. Echo has a greater range than expected, assuming you are reasonable and compare it to say a counter top CD player and not a shelf system. I look forward to Amazon coming out with a wireless subwoofer to pair with it to boost the range even further. Ahem, Amazon. - It's already clear to me that this is game-changing technology. Forgiving the learning curve that all voice recognition software is still going through, being able to tell your furniture what you want and having it obey is pretty amazing! It first dawned on me what a difference this will make when after less than 24 hours I was in the car running errands and actually found it inconvenient that I had to find the song on a CD I was looking for using my hands. I know, right!!? - I poured over articles on the Echo prior to it shipping - sidebar: kudos to Amazon for how this product was launched, brilliant marketing psychology - and much has been said comparing Echo to assistant offerings from Apple, Google, and Microsoft. I agree with the assessment of some that to have this functionality native to your home environment and not tethered to a device is a major positive leap. Amazon has done something very, very right by being first major retailer to market. - Echo is a no-brainer purchase if you have Prime. Without Prime, the initial launch capabilities are quite a bit more limited. That said, there's no sensible reason not to have Prime because Prime members save a hundred bucks on the Echo (current as of writing anyway)... and Prime is a hundred bucks. So you'd pay the same for Echo and Prime as you would Echo without Prime. Amazon is taking all the right logical steps while launching this product. To expound on Prime functionality, the gimmicks of asking Echo about time, weather, jokes, shopping lists, etc. are fairly useful, but Echo isn't yet able to pull free-form answers from the web. You can ask her to define or describe something from Wikipedia, but ask her a question that would require contextual understanding and you get nowhere. That's not a failing on Amazon's part; we're on our way to the future, not there yet. I'm excited for all this to come, but at this stage the greatest benefit of Echo, at least for us, is being able to play our Prime music on command. Remember, beyond what's on Prime, you can upload your own music to the Amazon Cloud and put your normal playlist at your beck and call - literally. Enhancements and features I'd fully expect to see in the near-ish future: 1) Voice Profiling - recognition and variable permissions by individual profile - our 7-year old would have ordered 3 ""laptops"" and one ""new laptop"" within the first hour of us having the Echo if purchasing were turned on... As nearly every article suggested, it's clear that Amazon is creating a new kind of storefront with this product. Profiling as a safeguard is an extremely logical enhancement. 2) Satellite Units - having one unit in a open space is great, but before long Echo will no doubt offer satellites in different spaces capable of separate operation, but with the benefits of a central control system. Like some of today's whole-home sound systems but with the power of voice operation and Cloud-connection to blow the doors wide on what's possible. 3) Contextual Information - the future all of us expect, when our innate computer system can answer our far-reaching questions in the context we intend them. 4) Humor - I'd be shocked if someone at Amazon isn't pouring over the data on what people are asking their Echoes to figure out what sorts of humorous Easter eggs they should load into it. (Ask yours ""Alexa, open pod bay doors"".) Hey Amazon, give everyone in the office an extra free 15 minutes a day to come up with this kind of wacky stuff. It's how we show off our new toys and impress our guests into wanting one! 5) Peripheral Speakers - like satellite units, but with the intent to expand the audio capability. Subwoofer, etc. 6) Audible.com - no doubt coming very soon is the ability to play audible.com books, and hopefully rival formats at some point too. I don't even own a single audio book, but this is so obvious a function I have to believe it was one of the last things to hit the cutting room floor at Amazon when they were figuring out what capability they could launch with. 7) Full Amazon Universe - along with audible.com, there's no reason not to expect full integration with Amazon's universe of products and businesses. E.g. Fire TV already breached voice search; that control should go native and un-tether itself from a remote very quickly now. 8) Control of Other Functions - Echo is a simple step toward voice control over other household functions (thermostat, lighting, locks, etc.) that are already fast finding themselves a part of the ""internet of things"". I'm smitten with this thing and I could go on, but I won't. If you haven't already purchased an Echo, you might be thinking of waiting until some of these other functions exist or the voice-recognition system has matured. If you have the $100-$200 to spend though, I would urge you not to wait. Be part of the early user base that Echo consistently improves itself on and watch with excitement as the new features roll in over the coming months. I seriously doubt you'll regret it. This thing is already amazing! Thumbs up for the product, price and thumbs up to you! If this review helped please thumbs back.",null,null,,null
Review: 500 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"June 30, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I bought this with a bonus from work for fun since I got an invite for $100. I was impressed with how easy it was to setup. Actually it took far longer to download the app to my phone than to setup Echo once I did. I found controlling Echo to be fairly intuitive with some exceptions. It is fun however to keep discovering new things we did not know Alexa could do. We love the way we can play music anytime. Especially in the kitchen when your hands are dirty, you can just ask her to play and you have music. The voice recognition for us is impressive. I can speak plainly and in a normal voice. No yelling required. She even understands my son that does not always enunciate very well. The best thing in my opinion is that there is the ability to add features without having to buy new equipment. I am confident they will add more features we are looking for over time. Look at what's been added in the last 6 months. Very cool to have her read your Audible books. (well she doesn't read in her voice) but just ask her to read a story and she will put on the book you are currently listening to on Audible. Looking forward to new features being added.",null,null,,null
Review: 280 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"October 19, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I'm liking Alexa more than I thought I would. A friend of mine has been raving about Alexa and for the longest time I couldn't figure out why I'd have one. I like gadgets, but this is quite an expensive one if you don't know how you'll use it. I have several laptops, tablets, smart phones...did I really need Alexa? In fact I did and I do and here's why: Pros: - My kids can ask Alexa how to spell words. Granted, sometimes she mishears words. But about 98% of the time, she gets it right. ""Mom, how do I spell 'castle'?"" Ask Alexa! - She can play music from Prime stations, Prime music and your music library. This is actually so nice, because right when my hands are full of whatever I'm making for dinner, it's great to say ""Alexa, play some 80's music"" - She has a pleasant voice and speaks fluently - She has good sense of humor programmed in. My kid asked her to self-destruct and she answered ""Commencing self-destruct sequence. 5 4 3 2 1 BOOM. Well, that didn't go as planned."" - She can tell you jokes. - She can read books from Audible or books from Amazon prime that are enabled for narration. The Audible books are read in the original voice and the Amazon prime books, she reads in her voice - a bit monotonous, but not bad when you're tired of reading yet another Minecraft novel to your kids. - She can tell you the forecast or the current weather in various locations. - She can tell you entries from Wikipedia - She can add things to your shopping list or your to do list - SKILLS! There are lots of skills you can enable through the Alexa app - like the ability to translate to Spanish...it's not perfect, but it's a good start - she's always learning and Amazon is adding new features Just now my kids were asking her if she has hands, and she answered that she has no body. Ask her if she has babies, and she says she doesn't have a family but has friends. Ask her who her friends are and she says lots of people talk to her. And the best, she knows the 3 rules of robots! Cons: - yes, there are some cons...most important one is that she won't connect to my Instant Pot Smart and cook my supper! Things I wish she'd do: - Connect to Overdrive! Yes, you can play Overdrive audio books (and if you don't know what Overdrive is, it's an app/site for managing library ebooks or audiobooks - meaning free if your library supports Overdrive and has an ebook/audiobook collection) on Alexa, but she is then just functioning as just a bluetooth speaker. you can't tell her to read a certain book and you need to involve another device. - Connect to the Instant Pot Smart. Yes, I also mentioned this as a con in jest. If you don't know what an Instant Pot is, it's an electric pressure cooker and the Smart model comes with bluetooth. I want to be able to control it via Alexa. - She should be able to do more AI. When she's confused, she typically says ""Hmm. I don't know how to help you with that"" or ""I don't understand your question"". You should be able to tell her a more Alexa style command then so she can associate the 2 ways of saying something - I can only control one to do list and one shopping list. I use Google Keep for my lists and Outlook for my calendar. And my husband and I share a google account in addition, so that we can keep joint lists in Keep. She should be able to interface with that. I think this is a major handicap. I realize Amazon wants you to use everything Amazon...but this is why PC's became better than Apple computers. You can't be an isolationist. People don't want to switch over all their apps to Amazon supported ones. - Amazon has my profile (who's in my family). Every person in my family, except the 2 year old, has a Fitbit and yet Alexa can only tell me the status of mine as she's connected to my account. - I should be able to create a to-do list for my husband. This is a major flaw. If my husband is on my Amazon family profile, I need to be able to create items for him. As in, ""Alexa, put fix faucet on my husband's to-do list."" Seriously, this is supposed to be be a family gadget, so why can I only create one to-do list? Very primitive. - The Alexa app is a pain to use in the store to actually use my shopping list. There are 3 or 4 steps to get into it. Google Keep is much better. I enjoy being able to tell her what to add, but then retrieving that data isn't convenient. - She needs to get an urban dictionary! Or the ability to use other dictionaries - like one for Minecraft. For when my kid wants to know how to spell ""Herobrine"". - I wish there was a way to get her to recognize my voice so that she woudn't do my kids' homework. Why bother figuring out long division if you can just say ""Alexa, what is 48,234 divided by 343?"" - I wish you could tell her to look something up ""Alexa, google how to craft a diamond sword in Minecraft"" - I get the urge to talk to Alexa via my phone in the store...""Alexa, show me my shopping list"" and then realize, ""woe is me...Alexa isn't with me"" What I'm really excited about: - SKILLS - yes, I mentioned this before. But I'm not only excited about skills that other people create. I'm excited about skills I can create. I'm a software developer, so I'm excited about developing something that I can use on Alexa.",null,null,,null

Then we figured out that she like standards Frank Sinatra, etc. Now she has learned Alexa, play KABL radio, which is a radio station in San Francisco that plays her kind of music. She can also listen to the news (WBZ) or NPR (WGBH). We have a Wink hub and a couple of its light bulbs. I put a bulb in her room, and now show knows how to turn it off and on by voice Alexa, turn on my light. The nights are not so dark now.

It happens that we use OOMA for our landlines, and so now my mother says Alexa, ask OOMA to call Shirley and it makes the call for her. She also knows how to call me or my wife.

Review: 82 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Nov 14 00:00:00 EST 2015,"November 14, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Alexa was delivered at the same time my 21 year old daughter arrived home for a weekend visit from college. I was very excited unpacking the box. She was quite skeptical. ""What did you buy? What does it do? You talk to it? Why?"" For some reason, the younger generation balks at voice activated technology. Both of my daughters have turned off Siri on their iPhone and hate it when I talk to OnStar in my vehicle. After one day with Alexa, I can tell you that she understands more and responds much faster than both OnStar automated voice recognition and Siri. My first 15 minutes with Alexa: It was very easy to set up and pair with my iPhone 5S. I didn't even need to elicit the help of my very tech savvy daughter. It took no more than 5 minutes and you need absolutely no technical knowledge other than your wifi password. Now, time to play ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa gave a very nice weather report. My daughter rolled her eyes. ""Alexa, what time is it?"" Appropriate response by Alexa, more eye rolling by daughter. ""Alexa, tell me a joke."" Alexa told a joke. Daughter said, ""That was cute,"" and shrugged. At this point, I am not happy that my daughter's excitement about this new product is nowhere near mine. I'm grasping at straws here to reel her in. ""Alexa, what time do the Florida Gators play tonight?"" Alexa gives a very detailed answer including time, location and opponent. Daughter's eyes perk up. She addresses Alexa for the first time. ""Alexa, what time do the Patriots play?"" Another detailed answer by Alexa. More interest from daughter. ""Alexa, how old is Tom Brady?"" Alexa answers with his age and birthday. ""Alexa, who is Tom Brady married to?"" Another correct, detailed answer. She is clearly impressed. I told her it would play music also. ""Alexa, play Happy by Pharrell Williams"" and less than 2 seconds later the song is playing. She looks at me and says, ""OK, this thing is really cool."" I tell her it also has news updates. ""Alexa, what happened in Paris today?"" (We received Alexa on November 13, the same day as the Paris terrorist attack killing more than 160 people). Alexa connects to a very interesting NPR news broadcast bringing us a summary of what happened and the latest details being released. We listen, fascinated for about 5 minutes. ""Alexa, stop."" My daughter looks at me in disbelief and asks, ""How much does this cost?"" I told her $179 but it was on sale the day I bought it for $149. Now, she is truly incredulous. She thought I had spent ""way more than that."" I could not be more pleased. Alexa is VERY good at what she does, but does have limitations. She could tell us the current score of the North Carolina Tarheels basketball game and tell us the time remaining in the game. A word of advice, when dealing with sports teams, Alexa seems to respond better when you include the mascot name. Florida Gators gets the correct reply more often than University of Florida. Alexa could NOT tell us the leading scorer from the basketball game no matter how we phrased it and also could not tell us what team was ranked number one in college football after many attempts. These are improvements that can come with time. We will be patient. She quickly found the phone number and address for the closest Pizza Hut and another nearby restaurant about which we asked. Later that evening, I downloaded the Alexa App to my Kindle Fire HDX, wondering if I had messed up by connecting my iPhone first and if Alexa could handle two devices. It connected seamlessly to my Kindle Fire HDX, and I even had pictures of Tom Brady (always a good thing) and Giselle Bunch, more details from the Paris terrorist attacks and references to all of our earlier inquiries. Alexa sends updates to your Kindle Fire HDX and iPhone when you make inquiries. This is a very helpful feature. I also downloaded the IFTTT (if this then that) App to my iPhone and set Alexa so she could ring my cell phone if I say, ""Alexa, trigger find my phone."" Nice! I lose my phone at least twice a day. I also used IFTTT to send all items on my to do list with Alexa to my iPhone todo list. This worked perfectly. My first experience with IFTTT, and I liked it. I'm lying in bedcan't fall asleep. ""Alexa, play classical dreamtime playlist."" I immediately hear soothing classical music. Since it is a playlist, it will automatically stop when playlist ends. I don't have to worry about setting a timer. ""Alexa, softer."" I am now settling down and relaxing. ""Alexa, Good Night."" She replies with a soothing ""Good Night."" I quickly fall asleep wondering why I waited so long to buy my new, dear friend, Alexa. I should probably give 4 stars because it is still a work in progress, but give it 5 because it is just really awesome! I may order the remote- doesn't seem necessary, but may be fun to prank husband and family. I will update this review after a few months of use, since this was only my first day.",null,null,,null

Jeff Bezos and his team have outdone themselves in bringing this to the market. I was tethering on buying a BOSE radio/CD player as I love the sound it emits throughout the room. Now that I have the Echo I am so happy I went with this instead. Not only do I get a great sounding player sans the CD player but the sound is incredibly awesome. And it does so much more than the BOSE can do for me. I am ecstatic with the ability to have Alexa make a to-do-list for me and tell me the weather as well as read to me when I am busy doing other items I enjoy. I can truly tell you that I am now a true Amazon tech junkie with my Fire tablets, Fire Stick, and now the Echo. I will probably become a FIRE mobile phone junkie once the quirks are worked out in the future. I know others are saying that unless you have Amazon Prime it isn't worth it.

Review: 490 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"August 29, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"The Echo has become an indispensable part of our house at this point. I'll review the 3 features we use the most: We have integrated it with our Wink hub and it allows us to easily control our lighting and other smart switches with voice alone. The feeling is very Star Trek - the only thing I'm waiting for in this feature at this point is the ability to verbally adjust dim levels (right now it only supports on/off control). Pandora integration is very smooth and I like that Alexa understands many ways of saying your opinion of a song (everything from ""Alexa, please mark this song as thumbs down"" to ""Hey, Alexa, this song sucks!"" to ""Alexa, this song is great!"" is understood and translated into a rating). One minor issue with this feature is that sometimes Alexa will require very literal naming of your station (a station called ""My Britney Spears Station"" can't be called ""The Britney Spears Station"", for example). This seems to be improving as Alexa's software is updated, though. Timers are very useful, and now that the Echo supports multiple timers it's easy to use it for timing several parts of a meal while cooking. We ended up putting the Echo remote on the fridge and use that to send Alexa our timer requests and conversion questions, as she has trouble hearing from around the dividing wall between our kitchen and living room. The remote works very well and communicates quickly. As for features that are not really good enough for me to use yet: Alexa seems to have some kind of mental block against reading Audiobooks - you need to very carefully state ""play my Audiobook,"" [title], ""by"", [author] or she will not understand. The lack of input flexibility in this feature is a little disappointing considering how flexible the rest of the features are with what you can say. Saying ""Alexa, play some music"" is a very dangerous thing, as you will get a *truly random* station, which is never what anyone actually wants. Anything from 80's rock anthems to classical etudes. Hopefully they can switch this feature to do something more useful like tapping into your last played music or your amazon recommendations. The flash briefing is cool, but there is no way to skip stuff you're not interested in or pause the feed while it is going. If you interrupt Alexa with basically any command while she is doing the flash briefing, she will immediately stop and start over from the beginning if ordered to resume. This is a problem as it locks Alexa down for the whole duration of the briefing. In spite of the above issues, I still give the product 5 stars, because I have already seen how amazing the updates to this product can be, and Amazon seems to really be listening to users and giving us the features we want in updates. I can only see this device becoming more useful with time.",null,null,,null

It definitely has cool features, but nothing like the tech critics have been saying about it. The worse part is that no matter how you play your music through it (there are several options), ECHO cuts the song off by several seconds. And, if you play your music above the lowest settings, she cannot hear you over it when you tell her to lower volume. Yet it does have a really great sound for music. Probably has many additional features that are wasted on me too, such as lightbulb control (but you need very specific expensive bulbs)",null,null,,null

And from Day One, it has earned a place in my home for delightful, and practical uses. I want to actually write two reviews. First one for the Echo hardware, and a second for the Alexa software and personal assistant voice recognition. However, this forum will only permit one review for this product. Locating the Amazon Echo in your Home I live in a fairly standard apartment: bedroom, bathroom, living area and kitchen. I have one Amazon Echo, and have chosen to leave it at that for the moment because there is enough commentary on the Internet of the complexities of having two. I purchased an extra power adapter. So in the evening when I go to bed I move it to my nightstand in he bedroom. During the day, I move it to my day living area + kitchen. With an extra power adapter prepositioned in the living area it is easy to move there. Th only difficulty I sometimes encounter is that when I am ""around the corner"" from the device, it does not always respond to my voice. I can remedy that by simply getting in ""eye contact"" with Alexa, the voice recognition software The microphones in the device are well executed, other than when I am clearly out of earshot of the device, it is the first magical effect of having an Amazon Echo. The Echo allows you to move about your daily activities in your home and speak your thoughts and commands, and Alexa will ""hear"" you. When you are interacting with Apple's Siri, Google's ""now"", or Microsoft's ""Cortana"" you need to be pating attention close visually to a computer or smartphone.. To be able to speak your thoughts, and be heard is the first magical aspect of Amazon Echo/Alexa. My uses for Amazon Echo/Alexa I have successfully used Amazon Echo/Alexa for: 1) Speaking back to me my upcoming events on Google Calendar. It will not ""yet"" allow me to schedule an event. 2) As I move through the day in my home, I can add items to my Shopping List and To do List. When I am away from Echo away from home, I can call up that shopping list in the grocery story in my smartphone in the Alexa app. 3) I listen to Amazon Prime playlists, in particular Putting the Baby to Bed when I am going to sleep and the Mozart playlist during the day. 4) I control my Phillips Hue task lighting at my living room sofa, bed nightstands, and bathroom lights. I can turn them on, off, and vary the intensity. 5) I have become very fond of awaking and asking Alexa to read my Flash News Briefing. 6) I use Alexa to start reading me back my Amazon Audible spoken word books There are yet more features of the device to explore and use regularly. Since I have purchased the Echo, Amazon had added features to the personal assistant service about once every two weeks - so I know this is a key investment area for Amazon.

I was intrigued but I'm somewhat of an audio snob and like to hear music playing on my sound system. The Echo had no way to connect to my sound system for playback. Another problem for me was that, unlike my brother, I am not a PRIME member. However, I liked all the other stuff Echo could do (Pandora, Radio Stations, general questions, etc.) so I spent some months reading the reviews. As soon as I saw it on sale on Black Friday I ordered my own and I'm so glad I did! Setup was painless and ""she"" did a good job of hearing me even before any voice training. As we were going through checking various stations and Pandora I said, ""Alexa, play some chamber music."" Her response: ""I can't find a chamber music station on Pandora, playing chamber music from IHeartRadio."" I was hooked! If she can't answer some question I'll have her check Wiki. In fact, I can drill down a level in some cases. For instance, ""Alexa Wiki The Beatles Taxman"" will go right to that Wiki page for the song TAXMAN and Alexa will start reading. Then she'll refer you to the app for more OR you can say ""Alexa more"" and she'll continue reading. My only complaint is within the skills section. (This is a common gripe.) I keep a cheat-sheet of the various commands used to start the skill. Launch, start, ask, open, play, tell, are some of the options and it's confusing without the cheat-sheet. Also, the skills could be better organized. Still 5 stars. So after a few weeks of listening to all that is available, I was hearing more new and great music than I've heard in a long time. My next step was to add some Wemo switches and get a membership to Amazon Prime Music account. That's only 25 bucks a year and enabled me to upload as many as 250,000 songs. (That's much more than my collection by the way.) The upload was time consuming but worth it. Echo is always on, always playing and always ready. This is the best piece of technology I've ever owned. I intend to purchase the Dot at some point but will never replace the Echo. Even if you don't have a Prime membership the Echo is still a great buy. I haven't even mentioned the news/weather/shopping/timers/alarm functions but they get used on a regular basis as well. The idea that it is always on is a great feature. When some question pops into my head and I can just ask Alexa: Who was in the group Badfinger? Who directed Empire of the Sun? How many calories in a Big Mac? What was Pink Floyd's 5th album? Ask the dog if he's hungry? (added skill) When did Woody Guthrie die? What was Stanly Kubrick's 11th film? You get the idea. Now stop reading this and order an Echo for yourself.

For one, it is so much easier to control everything at home, especially on days when I am too lazy to get out of bed. Alexa understands me very well. The only issue that had was how I have to be near my Echo in order for it to work, and I did not want to spend the money buying the remote ($30!). There was once when I only realised that I had forgotten to turn off the WeMo lights I have at home when I had reached the office. That was when I started to search for other ways to control my home-automated devices even when Im not near my Amazon Echo. Recently, I stumbled upon this new mobile app called Roger, which actually allows you to talk to Alexa through the app itself. It works even better than the Remote, since the app is completely free! Its an app that allows you to talk to anyone, and all you have to do is add Alexa like any other contact, and you can start talking to her. Since then, it has opened up so many new ways for me to use my Amazon Echo. Personally, it is the capabilities of Alexa that made me buy my Amazon Echo in the first place so its great that now I can now make Alexa do what I want, when Im not with my Echo.

I was a bit disappointed at first: the name (Alexa) could not be preprogramed and chosen. Secondly, there were limits on other applications and linking equipment. It has slowly gotten better in the number of things you can do with it and Amazon has made some effort to continue to grow its applicability. That being said, I do not have a multitude of items that are linked to it. I use it mostly as an enhanced alarm clock. Be advised, if your power goes off, no alarm/Echo. It would be great to have a battery backup. Also, if your wifi is down, no features. The good is that I can go to bed and just tell it ""Alexa, set the alarm for 5 am"" and never touch anything....you would not believe how great this is....especially in the AM when I say ""Alexa, off"" ""Alexa, set the timer for 15 minutes"", so I can get a few more zzzzz's. No reaching in the dark trying to find an alarm button. I like telling it to read from my audible account or listen to classical when in the bedroom. It is also helpful to have a newsletter email on new things you can do with Alexa. I wish these were available in audible so I could just listed to them on the way to work! I am currently programming the traffic feature. I recently purchased two of these for Christmas presents. One for a technology-savy friend, who loves it. One for my elderly aunt and uncle, who needed help in setting it up and were a bit challenged by the need for an app. They do not have an iphone or smart phone and still have a line in telephone. Once set up, they have it in their kitchen and while my uncle uses it to listen to Stan Getz, my aunt uses it for notes and reminders. Both were pleased with it. But I think they use it through their computer. I hope that Amazon continues to work on the applications that can be associated with the Echo and find a way to use it without having the app. It is the best of this kind of technology. I took a point off for (1) limitation on the name (Alexa), (2) failure to have a backup battery, (3) limits on connecting with other technologies. Linking with other echos is not of importance to me since all run off of your app. There was a problem right after the Amazon Tap and other item came out, due to some software or other upgrade and my system needed rebooting. I thought I had a power failure, but a friend in another state had the same issue. I have never used customer service for this.",null,null,,null

Alexa do I need a jacket? And so on...I will say, it's quite an adjustment because I've accidentally called Alexa ""Siri"" on more than one occasion. I wish she could play music from my cell phone or tell me when my phone is ringing so I can turn the music down but overall...so far...I like having her around to ""Play some yoga music"" at the end of a long day or ""wake me up in an hour after my nap."" I'm not disappointed and neither will you. OH: (obviously) don't turn the volume up too loud or she won't hear you. Also, be sure to add feedback on whether she does what you want her to do or not because it allows her to adjust to you and your accent (if you have one).

Otherwise the voice recognition isn't very good, and even when Alexa hears you correctly, it doesn't understand or does the wrong thing more often than not. As an example, I asked Alexa to play ""Gustav Holst"" and Alexa repeatedly interpreted this as ""Play Gustav Holst Holiday"" which is apparently just holiday carols and not even orchestral. In the app I could see that Alexa had heard me correctly, but was inserting the extra word and creating an entire new Pandora channel instead of playing the already existing channel that matched exactly. Additionally, Alexa often responds to the TV, even when the volume is low and I'm speaking right next to the device. Alexa also has trouble with sibilants and softer consonant sounds. The word ""Stuff"" is frequently interpreted as ""stop"" and asking Alexa to turn on a light group called ""colors"" resulted in Alexa adding salsa to my shopping list. As far as sports, you can only ask about specific teams. If you say ""Alexa when is the next NFL"" game, or ""Alexa, what teams are playing on Thursday"" you will get no answer. Other simple things that don't work, asking for a list of books by a specific author, trying to get Alexa to read you a recipe, asking anything from around a corner, even if only 10 feet away, asking Alexa about a specific area code.",null,null,,null

Review: 298 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"June 26, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"This was on my Wishlist for several months before I finally hit Add To Cart. I've been a techie kind of guy since the days of ""transistor radios,"" and also a music lover. So wanting an Echo of my own was somewhat inevitable. But I dislike issuing voice commands to devices. For example, I replaced my trusty Samsung Note 3 with an iPhone well over a year ago and I do love it, but I have not used Siri once. The device is hefty and a bit futuristic looking, and I like that. When playing music through it, I quickly discovered that most songs (Blues, Rock, 90s Country, 60s Oldies) sounded nothing less than awesome, while some others sounded a bit muddy. I concluded that two things were at play: the complexity of the recording, and my choice of where the Echo had been physically placed in the room. Overall, the sound improved when I moved the Echo off of my computer desk and instead placed it on the kitchen/living room pass-through, as shown in my photo below. In fact, it then sounded quite different depending on which of those rooms I happened to be in, so the acoustics of the room do matter. But the downward-firing, monoral speaker configuration simply can't produce a high-fidelity sound if the original recording contains too many mixed-in instruments. This is just not the norm, however. I think the best way I can describe the quality of the sound is that it's not unlike what you would get from a good FM table radio. If it was the only audio device you owned because of space or cost, you would be pleased. But in a competition between the Echo and my $200 iPod boom-box, the boom-box would win, but not by so much that the Echo would become nothing more than a dust-collector. (Prime Audio, Pandora One and Spotify Premium were my audio sources.) The techie in me also needed to have some wi-fi home automation gear for it to control. In no time at all, I had added four TP-LINK Smart Plugs and three Philips Hue light bulbs. Setup was quite simple, and I absolutely love using Echo to turn my lights on or off because my hands are full, or I'm sitting on the couch. Main uses: -- I didn't think I would care about the Alexa app's Shopping List and To Do List, but I always did keep such things on paper and now I no longer do. You can even access your lists from your phone while away from home, shopping. -- In the morning when I'm checking my e-mail, I have Echo read me my Morning Briefing and give me the weather report. -- When I'm sitting out on my balcony, I can hear the music from my Echo loud and clear right from where I've positioned it, and never go past '6' on the volume scale. (Mono is as good as stereo if you're sitting somewhere that your ears can't differentiate between the two channels -- in fact, it can even be better than stereo because no such differentiation is necessary or even possible.) -- While looking for things in the refrigerator, I can add things to my shopping list without having to look for the list or something to write with. -- Timers and alarms. You can set the timer/alarm volume separately from the music volume, which means you can make it much louder than you would ever set it for your music. You won't overcook those hard-boiled eggs ever again! Bottom line: an easy five stars, well-built, sounds great, and a bargain at its current price. Just don't be too excited about the different ""Skills"" you can utilize through it, as most are not much more than novelties.",null,null,,null

Husband bought her for me for Christmas, at my request. Excellent sound quality. Nice styling. She is very trainable or, I should say she trains us - how to ask her questions. She has a few quirks that I have yet to get worked out. She cannot recognize our location - not her fault since Amazon defaults back to another location - the largest of the three areas our zip code covers. I would have preferred the option to change to an English/British accent. It would appear that she was not programmed to do that. Otherwise, her voice is excellent, clear and exactly how I would want it. Thank GOD Amazon chose an educated, clear and concise voice. She recognizes my husband's and my voice commands equally well. She will skip a song but, not pause. She repeated some jokes but when I asked her to tell me new jokes, she did and she hasn't repeated any again. You can ask her to tell a knock knock joke too. Few jokes are lame. Most are really funny - excellent. I got annoyed with her at one point, on day 2 I think. She was just not understanding me and I told her - loudly - to Shut Up. She politely told me ""that's not very nice"". I apologized & she said ""that's okay"". I will not lose my temper with her again. She does not deserve that. After all, we're in training and she learns - I learn - quickly, how to rephrase something or how NOT to pause when I am slow at asking or take my time deciding which song to ask her to play - when I change my mind mid-way. She has better things to do than to wait for me to decide, right? Actually, you cannot expect her to process a complicated change mid-sentence. But, those issues were on one day only. I have gotten to know her rather well and I now know what I want when I ask her. If she isn't sure, she usually asks anyway - something like ""Do you want me to add xxx to your Pandora account?"". I think she is great, entertaining, she learns quickly (and so do I) and the speaker sound quality is great.

The echo device is the option I wanted from the start, so the Sangean has been relegated to bedroom CD player from now on. But asking Alexa the weather, and other questions is super handy as well. I think Amazon blew Apple away with this device, and as of today, you will too. Tomorrow is another day, and Apple will probably come out with something that does slightly more, but costs double. Meanwhile, get one of these and see for yourself. Update: if you plan to use this device for your lighting keep this in mind. Every light must remain in the ""on"" position.

Another issue I had with this device is how closed source it truly was, not only does it not connect to Spotify or Google music but it uses ancient apps like Pandora and I heart raido I understand why but it sacrifices what this speaker can truly do by staying closed source to Amazon.

Theres no other way to describe it other than this thing is SWEET! Set up took me less than three minutes from box to fully functional and then to further integrate my smart lights fully probably took another 2 to 3 minutes. Setup is very intuitive and easy and I would say 80% of it you can do with your voice. Some of the cool features are: if you have smart lights you can use the companion iOS app to group them by room: so instead of turning on each individual light in my living room I can just say Alexa, turn on my living room lights as long as the lights in the living room are in that group they all turn on simultaneously almost instantly. You also can set the dim level with your voice, a very cool feature. I also have it linked to my Pandora account so I can simply say Alexa, play my beastie boys station on Pandora and it brings it up. You can also do things like online newsfeeds from NPR, simply by saying Alexa, newsfeed you can also customize whats in your newsfeed so if you dont care about economic news for example you can use the app and it will automatically learn to skip over that portion of the prerecorded newsfeed for you. You can link your iPhone to it at this time if you want to use it as a Bluetooth speaker to play your music through but one thing you cant do is have it play specific artist through your phone if youre using iTunes. It well if you use the Amazon music service however. You can also make grocery list, check the weather, get sports scores, etc.apparently you can buy items off Amazon with your voice but I havent tried that yet. Eventually I think you will be able to say things like Alexa, turn on my TV to channel 3 and it will turn on your TV and tune to the right station. My cable box already does this in a limited capacity. I really put the omnidirectional microphones to the test last night. I tested its ability to pick up my voice from my bed last night. The Echo was on the other side of a wall with a door open, with a air cleaner running, it was still able to pick up my voice 80% of the time. I would say the recognition accuracy out of the box is about 95% but then I discovered late last night that there is a training portion of the companion iOS app that Im going to try tonight to get my accuracy a little higher but if I remember to really enunciate it does a really good job. The audio quality from the speaker is pretty good considering all the rest of the features that are packed into this little cylinder. Its certainly not a Bose sound link mini or anything but it does a really decent job. Perhaps what I was most impressed with was the quick response of the device overall. I would say the vast majority of the time I would give it a command and it would do what I asked in under a second. This is a great device and I would say that the possibilities are endless for what the future may hold for it.",null,null,,null
Review: 201 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Thu Aug 04 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"August 4, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Ok, so I read a bunch of reviews, watched a few videos, and even read an e-book before purchasing the Echo. I think that people were so enamored by the promised technology that it's hard to find the information I wish I had thought of before making the purchase. Amazon refunded with no cost to me, I always feel bad returning things because I try to make informed decisions before making the purchase in the first place. I thought that it would be useful as a bluetooth speaker, home-automation hub, and virtual assistant. It turns out it's not. Package: Great! Really makes you feel that you're buying a premium product. The Echo: The echo looks great, and the cool lighting pattern is soft and intuitive. Setup was a breeze with the app. Echo itself feels fairly cheap for the price, and the audio distorts at high volumes (anything above 8 on Alexa's 1-10 volume scale). Alexa is able to hear me from about 20 ft away with no other sound, but was unable to hear me from 3 feet away if volume was 7. I found that Alexa understood me (a native American adult without accent) about 15% of the time, it misunderstands the children about 50% of the time. Stock Features: Echo is able to do basic things like - Weather reports, time/date, set alarms, Wiki information, various Easter eggs (flip a coin, rock/paper/scissors, simon says), etc. - Make To Do or Shopping lists: Since these lists are only available by Amazon (Alexa app or website) I found them cumbersome and stopped using them after the novelty wore off. - Play music from Prime Music: As a prime member, I was quite excited about this. Prime has an impressive collection of music that I'm paying for. Unfortunately, Alexa misunderstands me often enough that I'm not able to play what I want to. I said, ""Alexa, play dance music"" and it would play slow Jazz. I said ""Alexa, play Heaven on Earth"" (an album in my library), it would say it couldn't find it. - Read Audiobooks from Kindle: As someone who has a number of Kindle Books, this alone made me consider keeping it. Unfortunately, it lost it's place regularly. And would regularly tell me that there were no audiobooks in my library when I asked it something like, ""Alexa, resume Kindle book How We Love."" Also, when it finally did recognize what I wanted it gave a 5 second plug for Audible...c'mon Amazon. Apps: Yes, there is an ever expanding App/Skill library to do nearly anything. I found the syntax to be really annoying. For example with the Bible App installed if I said, ""Alexa, read John 3:16 from the Bible"", it doesn't know what I'm talking about. I have to say exactly, ""Alexa, ask the Bible App to read John 3:16""; if you miss any words, even 'the', Alexa will not understand you. This need for exact syntax makes me not want to use any apps. Why it didn't work for me: - As a bluetooth speaker: It's not battery powered...and so not that portable: and if you unplug it, it loses some of its settings. Also the volume distorts above 8, and it can't hear your above 7 so stops being useful. - As a home hub: Yes, you can jerry-rig IFTTT to make Echo do nearly anything. But you could configure IFTTT to be much more fluid. - As an assistant: The limitations and misunderstandings make this not a reality. In conclusion, I think this technology is still in the brick-phone stages. It's a really neat technology, but hasn't been perfected to the point of usefulness yet. Google Home is set to drop later this year (2016) so maybe that will change the game?",null,null,,null

The current Alexa training sentences are so geared for the younger folks, and hard to manage for the elderly. 3. If there isn't a searchable database of apps that can be used with Alexa, please someone put one together. Make it easy to learn more about what Alexa can do. 4. Make the volume sensitive to variations in ambient sound levels. Okay, that's all I've got, so far. Many thanks for developing this tool. The nursing home is writing an article on technology that improves the quality of life for the elderly and Alexa will be at the top of their list.",null,null,,null

News, Traffic and Weather reports easily at the simple request. Alarms, calendars, reminders and to do lists simply by speaking them in. You can just speak a command and it will go into its get it done mode. There are a lot of commands and it is growing in abilities as it grows in popularity as well. I love the ability to say Alexa play me .. insert name of song. It will pull it up and play it! Very few songs I asked for where not available,. I was able to pull up news and weather and traffic with no issues. Much easier than trying to get n a device to check it. Being able to speak commands and no look up needed makes for a great gift for seniors or technology illiterate people. Its quick and easy to ask for definitions or terms. If you are like us, Alexa is a great novelty and very useful for specific things. I cant say she is life changing, but she is fun and if you like to have responsive items without a lot of research and do it yourself time, then she will help you with that. Playing with her is a daily thing at our house. Some of my families favorite functions involve music, so we ask her to pull up our playlist and channels and then we are in business to do our task while the music is going. Also, we have this in the family room, so when I want to wake up the kids and they are on that side of the house, I set the alarm and it makes for a good wake up call! I cant wait to see what is in store for the future, as it is still growing and in Beta mode, but I am sure it will go far! Way to go Amazon on a great product!",null,null,,null

She got hers first, and when we received the Echo, I used it for a week before getting it to Mom, so that I could explain to her how it worked -- and, after handing it over, I really missed it! So I really celebrated getting my own invitation and, then, my own Echo... especially since I got both at the introductory Prime cost of $99. I love Alexa! The only big problem I had with her was that, in the early days, she could not play Audible books, which seemed ridiculous considering that both were Amazon products. But like with syncing the Echo to my Google Calendar, Amazon continued to improve the device and now I can listen to audiobooks as well as radio stations and my prime music. Alexa was very easy to set up. She has a good speaker, making her an excellent source for music and radio (especially for low-vision Mom, who now does not have to struggle to find the right radio station). She's useful as a virtual assistant, with information about weather, definitions, Wikipedia overviews, flash briefings of the news, and traffic reports about my commute. Her being hands-free is a surprising luxury, from ""Alexa, set a timer for fifteen minutes"" to ""Alexa, volume up."" And -- this may seem sad -- but she's good ""company."" I really enjoy asking for a joke, or tossing a phrase like ""Who you gonna call?"" or ""Beam me up, Scotty,"" to get her reaction. Her voice, while computerized, is soothing and easy to understand. Of course there's always room for improvement. If I were to make suggestions, one would be to add a choice of a male voice, not because I don't like Alexa's current voice but because it's getting annoying that so many of these virtual servants (Siri, Garmin, Echo) are, by default, female. Male robots can be helpful too! I'd love it if Amazon gave the choice of a FEW more names besides simply ""Alexa"" or ""Amazon"" (presumably for people with a family member named Alexa). My Mom really wishes we could set a ""turn off in 20 minutes"" or ""turn off in an hour"" timer, so that she can have music playing while she falls asleep, without it playing all night. Also, it would be nice if we could take things OFF the shopping list or to-do list by voice command, rather than having to go to the website or use our app to do so (luckily, Alexa will only read the most recent 5 entries to each, unless you ask for more). I am very pleased, for myself and my Mom, with this device. Each of us uses it daily, and it makes life better. You can't ask for much more than that!",null,null,,null

We use it for weather every day. We ask her the time. My son was watching TV and they said a lake was 300 feet deep; he asked if that was deeper than the Statue of Liberty. I don't know - so we asked Alexa. (She says Lady Liberty is 305 feet). LOVE IT. She tells us when the Detroit Tigers are playing and whom. She times our cookies baking and more. LOVE HER!!! Sure, sometimes she can't answer. Sometimes we have to say things a second or third time, but overall, AMAZING!! I'm sure the software will improve, but if it never did I'd still give her 5 stars given how much we love the music playing. SOUNDS great! Amazon, if you are listening, here are the things I'd like to see added: 1) Give more name options. You can only call her Amazon or Alexa. We have an Alexa in the family, so not that. And we are always saying, ""Order that on amazon"" and activating her. How about ""Echo"" as an option? 2) Make external speakers. She sounds great! But I want to hear her when we are outside in the pool. 3) Make additional inputs, like where you can have one upstairs, downstairs and outside. We want her EVERYWHERE!!

On Prime Day, I knew that it would never be lower, so I bought it at a greatly discounted price. First, the pros: 1. Once the Echo is voice trained, it has full understanding of most questions it is asked. If it cannot find the answers, it readily tells you. 2. It plays all music on command, and I really like the Pandora interface. 3. It does Google-like searches in split seconds. 4. It reads books from Audible, and if told to pause, when it resumes, it picks up right where it left off. It also syncs to the iPhone and goes to the last read phase of the book, regardless of the device. The cons: There is only one con and for me, and it's a biggie. As stated earlier, I wanted the Echo for my extensive Audible library. Problem is, since my library is so large, it cannot find or play any of my books unles they are selected via the Alexa app. It is touted to be activated by voice command, a huge selling point for me, but as I said, it doesn't work! To some, it may be a small glitch, but for me, it was paramount. Think about finding a book in a huge physical library, and the headache of finding an Audible book in a huge library is understandable. I have been with Audble since 2001, and purchased at least two books per month since that date. Some months, I purchased four books. Do the math - a LOT of books. I have been given work-arounds by the Echo programmers, but none have given me a true solution. The Echo is an amazing device, and I have enjoyed using it everyday. I try to remain hopeful that it will eventually be a device that I can utilize to its full capacity.",null,null,,null

The only smart things around here are my iPhone, Apple Watch, and my 2 honor students. Smart home control is one of the major functions of the Echo, but I still just had to have it! I love futuristic gadgets! We use it for music, weather reports, timers, shopping, and as an intercom. Even if I never install a single smart home product in my house, the Echo will still have been 100% worth it. I'm amazed by the music selection available through Prime Music! Initially, I paired Echo with my iPhone so as to play music from my extensive iTunes library, but it turns out, I don't even need to do that! I could make my own Prime Music playlists, but the pre-made lists available are more than good enough. The 50 Great 90s Alternative Songs playlist couldn't be better if I'd made it myself! I ask Alexa for the weather first thing each morning and she gives an accurate report. I frequently use Alexa as a timer. When I cook, I often need several different times set. I use my Apple Watch in addition to my oven and microwave timer, and now Alexa can pitch in too. I was worried at first, because unlike those methods, I can't glance at Alexa to see how much time is remaining. I quickly learned I can find out by simply asking her, ""Alexa, how much time is left?"" I appreciate the ease of re-ordering items previously purchased on Amazon. When my daughter tells me we're low on guinea pig food, I can immediately ask Alexa to re-order more, instead of attempting to make a mental note to do it later, which I would inevitably forget. There's no risk of eroneous purchases because Alexa will verify my request by stating the size, brand and cost, and then she asks for my 4 digit code before actually transmitting the order. Using Echo with the remote has added an additional benefit, making use of the Simon Says feature. My house is not large but the acoustics are odd; my children cannot hear me if I yell for them from upstairs while they are downstairs. By keeping the remote in my bedroom, I can say, ""Simon says: Emily, it's time to load the dishwasher."", and Alexa relays the information for me. Additionally, I can control the music to skip, pause, and adjust the volume with the remote. Alexa is essentially Siri for the home. We love Siri, and we adore Alexa as well. I'm hoping for eventual improvements in her speech and personality. Alexa doesn't share Siri's wit and humor, and Alexa's voice is a bit stiff and robotic, but we don't hold it against her. Honestly, I'm surprised Apple missed the boat on this one! I wish there was a voice recognition feature, to prevent my teenage daughters from using the Echo. Every day after school, there is a verbal tug of war over the music. Alexa dutifully keeps up with their demands of ""play"" and ""stop"". I've heard the Amazon tablet can be paired with the Echo to display information related to requests. I might buy one to keep on a stand next to it, solely for that purpose. Overall, the addition of the Echo makes me feel more and more like Jane Jetson, as I've always dreamed of being. I will probably add some smart items to my home just for fun.

Let's say you were listening to flash breifing and you had to pause it after listening half of it because you got a call or you had someone at the door and now you want to resume the news from where it paused but no, you will have to listen too all the news again! Music: Every time I want it to play some songs on prime, it generally plays sample music. But it works great with Spotify. The only use I have of this expensive device is to ""play music from Spotify"" General stuff: Some users have mentioned that it's acting like a companion for them. One of the top ones even posted a picture sleeping with it but I think that's only a marketing campaign. It's not true. If a fan or heater is on making a hush sound Alexa goes deaf! You have to literally yell ""Alexa play Coldplay on Spotify"" for it to hear you. Alexa is worse for general conversations like some claiming it to be their companion - absolute crap. Most of the times it is confused and you'd hear ""I don't understand the question I heard"" or ""can't find answer to question I heard"". It can't answer simple questions like ""how do airplanes fly"". See screenshot from Alexa app attached on what it heard and that it heard me correctly but can't find answer to it or a logical answer to say no to my request but just a plain ""can't"". The device is supposed to entertain you with random questions with logical answers but all I hear most of the times is ""can't"" Alarms: I like to put fan on when I sleep and in mornings when I wake up to Alexa's alarm sound it can't hear me to stop the alarm coz the fan is on and then either I have to yell at her and get my day started with it or literally wake up and press that button on it for it to hear it. Alexa sits by the door of my bedroom so that I can talk to this device from bedroom or living room most of the times. Had it been only worth $20 I would not have complained much about it.

The Amazon Echo is the one device where'd you never expect how useful it could be. This has become my favorite smart home device, period. I have had this now since last year June and it keeps getting better with a growing ecosystem and weekly new features and integrations. Before having the Echo, many smart home devices such as the Wemo switch and the Philips Hue were hard to control. Now the Echo has become my hub for controlling my home. Here are some great examples what I use my Echo/Alexa for. - Daily news for breakfast - Controlling music on Spotify and Pandora ""Alexa play my Romantic Playlist on Spotify"" ; ""Alexa resume Pandora radio"" - Audible!! Love how this syncs with your Audible audio books. Real smooth, and Alexa has become my voice of education during cooking sessions. - Conversions -- I'm European so I first didn't know how many grams equal one ounce or how many miles equal one kilometer. Alexa made life easy on this one. - Weather - no brainer. - Podcasts. This one is a little trickier. Alexa doesn't always recognize the name of a certain podcast, simply because there's so many. But it does work fifty percent of the time. - Wikipedia/Facts. It's real easy to just have Alexa explain a few things I'm reading or discussing with someone. Alexa often ends up becoming the referee, i.e. if there's a fight about who's right or wrong we just ask Alexa! Incredible. :) - Timer -- again great utility for cooking. - Lights/Wemo integration - ""Alexa turn off my Bedroom Light"" -- yep works as easy as that. - IMDB ratings and movie showtimes - Bluetooth connectivity - sometimes I just like to watch a movie on my phone in the kitchen or listen to the Economist. For these occasions I simply say ""Alexa connect to Bluetooth device"" and it magically connects to my phone without a problem. Have I mentioned the sound is great? - Jokes. Alexa knows a ton of knock knock jokes, political jokes and more. It's more of a time waster, but still fun every now and then when you have guests over. - Wishlist. I'm not using this one as much as I should, but it's good every now and then. I'm sure there's a ton more. I'm barely even touching the surface here as I'm not using all the apps. What's good is the weekly email from Amazon explaining some of the features. There's definitely some learning curve involved here to make the most of the device. What am I missing? - August Smart Lock integration - Voice Dictation for notes (Evernote anyone??) - Calling function (seems like a no-brainer) - Emails ? Texts? -- not easy I know! - Better To-Do Lists like Wunderlist or Trello integration - Calendar integration is still a little lack luster. Wish I could have access to multiple calendars. - Measure commute time for biking & driving from place A to B (right now you can only set two standard locations, home and work) It's missing a lot still.

It is not annoying, it's not a waste of space, and it isn't ugly. 3) Try to place this device below waist level when standing, such as on a coffee table or a low shelf, the microphones pick up the voice a little bit better. Placing it close to the center of the room is better than next to a wall, but it will work well just about anywhere where it is placed. 4) There are so many great uses for this. If nothing else, it is great for being used as a spell checker, wikipedia/IMDB search, or conversion calculator. It is a bluetooth speaker, also will play music based on genre or mood and so much more. Hooking up your pandora account to the Echo is a must. 5) The drawbacks. Yes, well it includes the fact that the Echo doesn't know what to say to many questions or requests, even if they are simple. Echo doesn't have true artificial intelligence. It is just programmed to say specific responses when you trigger a specific phrase or word in her database. This doesn't seem like the best way to build an A.I. because the possibility of phrases and questions are really endless. Alexa needs to be able to better understand what people are asking her, and she absolutely needs to utilize Bing (her search engine of choice) so she can pull up answers easily found on the first search result. Right now, if you ask her many simple questions, like, the number of students that attend Old Dominion University, she doesn't know what to say. If she could use search to her advantage, she could have scanned the wiki page and seen that there are upwards of 33,000 students at ODU. I am really hoping Amazon will improve this device and not force any existing users to buy an upgraded model in the future (which is what I am worried about). I'm surprised Google hasn't come out with their own version by now, but it is most definitely exciting to see home automation and simple A.I. starting to become actually useful. Echo has incredible potential, and right now she is still a very useful device, but most of the time when I am messing around using the Echo, all I can see are the possibilities of incredible usefulness she could easily be doing in the future if Amazon really tries to develop this great product.",null,null,,null

This one is about a year and a half old. So, Echo or the Dot? What the Echo has (and is) is a robust Bluetooth speaker with sound that will fill an average-sized room. I happen to think it's a good speaker for it's size--not a bit cheap sounding. However, it was that speaker that made me want an Echo Dot because that can expand one's audio experience via auxiliary plug or Bluetooth, allowing you to listen through your better sound systems--something that mattered to me, so I have both. The Echo is all-in-one, plug and play. It's perfect for a home that essentially just has wifi. You plug it in the wall; put it on your wireless; download the Alexa app, and you're done. Then you can pair it as a Bluetooth speaker as well, to either your phone, tablet or PC. And finally, you get to talk to Alexa and she'll talk back while doing your stuff, but she's her own review. There really oughta be a separate place to review the Alexa Voice Service. If there' isn't I'll add an addendum here ,one of these days. She's a trip. I think the Echo is brilliant. I don't regret a dollar I spent, although I did get it at the intro price of around 90 dollars. I doubt I would pay full price for another for myself; not while I could get the same technology and as good or better sound from the Echo Dot , and for much cheaper, by plugging it to one of my good radios even. It loses a half point for that. The Echo would make a fantastic gift. It's bigger and comes in a bigger box than the Dot which gives it extra punch.

Already looking for a decent Bluetooth speaker to improve our music listening experience while working in the kitchen (we used to play it from our phones), the timing was good and the price was modest. The assistant features are pretty nice. We use the echo daily for setting timers, identifying song artists, measurement conversions and other minor tasks. Echo isn't the best at answering tougher questions, but I think this is mostly due to the interface. SIri offers potential answers in the form of webpages on screen, while Echo relies on speaking the answers back to you. (Echo does have an App interface that can provide additional information about questions you ask). The steady stream of improvements that have come along are among the features that have cemented Echo's place in our home. Playing music directly from Pandora is a daily use with the bonus of adjusting volume on command. Checking my calendar while I make coffee is very convenient. Reordering grits as I use the last of my package is scarily convenient. The single greatest feature of Echo in our house though, is its interface with Belkin WeMo light switches. I've set up 9 switches or devices in our home now so that turning on lights and fans is as simple as saying the words. I cannot express how thrilling this feature is, and I'm very hopeful for future expansions in this line. As a speaker, echo is far better than our phones for listening to music. We use it ourselves in the kitchen and it has also become our go to for parties because it is just easier than the stereo and the sound quality and volume is good enough. If you are very particular about sound quality, you might not have the same experience, but Echo certainly ranks with the available Bluetooth speakers. Echo's ability to understand my words is very good, though understanding questions has room for improvement. I believe that the Echo often responds that it doesn't understand the question when the more appropriate response is that it doesn't know how to answer the question. When other people are speaking as you talk to the Echo it gets muddled at times, but has often surprised me by picking up my commands anyway. I am excited to get emails from Amazon announcing new features as they become available, and the stream of improvements thus far gives one great hope for the future. I don't know how far Echo will go, but I can imagine wanting access to it from every room. Perhaps my only complaint about the Echo is the choice of ""wake words"" or command prompts. Alexa or Amazon are the only options. It would be great to customize this aspect.",null,null,,null

I was a bit disappointed at first: the name (Alexa) could not be preprogramed and chosen. Secondly, there were limits on other applications and linking equipment. It has slowly gotten better in the number of things you can do with it and Amazon has made some effort to continue to grow its applicability. That being said, I do not have a multitude of items that are linked to it. I use it mostly as an enhanced alarm clock. Be advised, if your power goes off, no alarm/Echo. It would be great to have a battery backup. Also, if your wifi is down, no features. The good is that I can go to bed and just tell it ""Alexa, set the alarm for 5 am"" and never touch anything....you would not believe how great this is....especially in the AM when I say ""Alexa, off"" ""Alexa, set the timer for 15 minutes"", so I can get a few more zzzzz's. No reaching in the dark trying to find an alarm button. I like telling it to read from my audible account or listen to classical when in the bedroom. It is also helpful to have a newsletter email on new things you can do with Alexa. I wish these were available in audible so I could just listed to them on the way to work! I am currently programming the traffic feature. I recently purchased two of these for Christmas presents. One for a technology-savy friend, who loves it. One for my elderly aunt and uncle, who needed help in setting it up and were a bit challenged by the need for an app. They do not have an iphone or smart phone and still have a line in telephone. Once set up, they have it in their kitchen and while my uncle uses it to listen to Stan Getz, my aunt uses it for notes and reminders. Both were pleased with it. But I think they use it through their computer. I hope that Amazon continues to work on the applications that can be associated with the Echo and find a way to use it without having the app. It is the best of this kind of technology. I took a point off for (1) limitation on the name (Alexa), (2) failure to have a backup battery, (3) limits on connecting with other technologies. Linking with other echos is not of importance to me since all run off of your app. There was a problem right after the Amazon Tap and other item came out, due to some software or other upgrade and my system needed rebooting. I thought I had a power failure, but a friend in another state had the same issue. I have never used customer service for this.",null,null,,null

The initial reaction to Echo was it was a gimmick, but that changed once we started speaking to Alexa and discovering what it can do. We've had Echo for a few months and it sits in our kitchen waiting to play music, answer questions, save appointments, add to our shopping lists, and even turn on/off our lights. Echo is an incredible speaker, so much so that our regular stereo has started to collect dust. It can get very loud if you want it to, but the sound is clear and the bass is deep. With IFTTT.com and more skills being developed, it is really automating our household. We purchasedto replace our family room's light bulbs and they work great! I will soon be adding more light bulbs around the house. Not only are they wi-fi enabled, but they save energy. My son loves changing the light's colors with his voice when he's playing Xbox and I've programmed IFTTT to dim the lights until they turn off after I say, ""Alexa, goodnight."" Echo makes it so convenient to ask what today's weather is or how's traffic and having it said back to me rather than having to look it up on my phone. You'll learn how much time you'll save using it over your phone. I've already ordered the Echo Dot (http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=14047587011) and am looking forward to having that in my office.

This is generation 1 but everyone using it already has a feel for what generation 4 will be. Place ""Alexa"" into your kitchen and within a day ""she"" will change your life. Your music is no longer at your fingertips because you don't have you touch anything to hear it. You don't have to extricate yourself from a task to switch songs or change the volume.

I was dumbfounded when I spoke into the ether and it worked! COOL! That's a game changer for me and has almost eliminated the need to be less lazy and adjust the Nest through the app on my Iphone. (Especially since - without Echo's help - IFTTT can also sense when I leave or arrive in the neighborhood and adjust my Nests accordingly.) For the Echo voice command to Nest I have to add an IFTTT script (or whatever you call it) for each temperature I desire but that's really not a big deal since I usually have the Nest set at like one of three temps anyway. It IS also very handy when your hands are filled with cooking supplies to be able to tell Echo, ""Alexa set timer for 10 minutes,"" and have the flexibility of setting a second timer in the same way. Very cool and downright practical. My daughter likes the Animal Guessing game as well or asking Alexa some silly math problem that gives a 25 digit answer. Echo is a fun and practical device.

If you like music, you'll quickly find that almost everything you want to hear will only be available as a 30 second sample whose full version can be bought via... Amazon music. But you've got your own huge collection of music you can stream, right? Nope. Echo won't play local music, even if you're serving it on your local network. Unless you buy a cloud storage account from... Amazon (and then upload your own music to their service). Even my TV and blu-ray player stream music from my local network. But not this ""networked"" speaker. So music is next to useless here. It will play Pandora, so if you use Pandora extensively you might have a use for it. The best functionality would have been as a hands-free telephone linked to your cell phone or synced to Google voice, but I doubt Amazon is going to allow access to a Google service. I bought this device for $150, but the limited functionality makes this about $100 too much. Since this is basically a portable Amazon cash register, they could practically give this away knowing that people will have to buy the content from Amazon. These limitations basically make this another bluetooth speaker with two advantages: it plays pandora and tells you the weather. A fairer price for this would have been $49.99. This deliberately limited device feels like Amazon trying to be Apple, but Apple fan boys are too loyal to crossover, and most others are going to feel too constrained by the business model. I hear they're releasing an API to open up the device's functionality, but unless Amazon relaxes their content restrictions it's likely they will reject/block the functionality this device really needs to be useful. If Amazon adds functionality that makes this device more useful, I will revise this review accordingly. I just looked at the list of ""added functionality"" and it looks like they've added some Beatles music and an audio book of A Christmas Carol (that expires in two days).

If you have to pay full price, then you may be better off waiting for likely software enhancements. .... 3 Months later : I've been using my Echo daily for about 3 months.

Instead, I get silly e-mails from Amazon for wonderful new Echo apps like the ability to order pizza. Frankly, I can do much better playing background music using a bluetooth speaker and a music player on my smart phone, tablet, or PC. As far as timers and alarms -- ditto. BTW - despite repeated ""training sessions"" Alexa still can't tell the difference between ""fifteen minutes"" and ""fifty minutes"".

The video ad for the product doesn't exaggerate at all; I can see in the Alexa app that it transcribes my questions with almost perfect clarity, which is no small technological feat. At the task of recognizing human speech, the Echo is a great success. However, it was at this point that things began to go downhill. Despite the Echo's impressive ability to understand words, it is fairly rudimentary when it comes to understanding language. It can only handle the simplest of commands or questions, mostly regarding the time, weather forecast, traffic, and basic information from Wikipedia. As a question-answerer, the Alexa algorithm is vastly inferior to Google. Technical abilities aside, the major weakness of the Echo is that it is only as good as the services it supports, which is to say ""rather mediocre."" Amazon has taken every opportunity to integrate other Amazon-run services with the Echo (e.g. Audible, Prime Music). For instance, let's take music streaming; the Echo can stream any song on Prime Music that is either free with Prime or already purchased by the user. And therein lies the problem; Prime Music isn't as good of a music streaming service compared to its competitors like Spotify. The selection of ""free"" music is rather limited, and I'm not very inclined to shell out $1 for the ability to stream a song that I can already play from Spotify with no additional fee. The same thing goes for Audible. I like Audible, but it's not the only place from which I get audiobooks. The Echo is useless if I want to listen to a non-Audible audiobook. The hardware of the Echo would allow it to be a smashing success if only it supported third-party apps and software. With the ability to understand speech already perfected, it would be incredibly easy to use the device as a voice-command platform for virtually any other application. But unfortunately, it's clear to me that Amazon is less interested in creating a great product than it is in getting the user to fully commit to using more of its own services. Perhaps for some users the Echo will be a highly useful device, but for most people it will not be worth the $180 price tag.",null,null,,null

It does need improvement in some areas. For example, you can't currently add an appointment to your Google calendar; you can only hear what is already on it. That said, I firmly believe that the areas needing improvement will be improved with frequent updates. As Alexa gets smarter, I think that this technology is nothing less than disruptive when it comes to user experience. I have read the articles comparing Alexa to Siri, Ok Google, & Cortana. Most of those articles demonstrate empirically that Alexa *currently* ranks low in terms of speech recognition, but that is sort of like saying a 10 year old LeBron James is a low-ranking basketball player if you compare him to a full-grown Michael Jordan in his prime. All Alexa needs is a little time (and more voice interaction) and the speech recognition will improve. Personally, I have been pretty amazed at Alexa's ability to recognize my requests. More to the point of this being a disruptive technology in terms of user experience, Alexa is always standing by to help at the sound of my voice. The same can't be said for Siri, Ok Google, or Cortana presently; they all require some physical, tactile form of interaction with hardware such as pushing a button and then vocalizing your command. With Echo, I can bark requests at Alexa from my couch or when darting through the kitchen during my morning rush. Physically, the Echo is not an unattractive device and it blends-in well with your environment. We have ours sitting on a dark stained wooden credenza between our kitchen and living room and it is easy to forget that it's there. The sound is outstanding from such a little package. Really, this part continues to amaze me. The ability to verbally set timers, alarms, get the news, get traffic reports, add items to a list, etc are very useful and I do actually use them daily. The only not-so-positive thing I have to say about the Echo & Alexa in general is that Amazon is currently not offering a way for software developers (such as myself) to earn money off of useful applications they may develop for Alexa (& Echo). Sure some of us will put some weekend-project novelty apps up for free (I developed one this weekend), but the truly amazing apps will be fueled by the potential for profit so I don't expect Alexa's full potential to be realized until there is a way for developers to monetize their apps.

I have Alexa connected to my Nest app (Nest Thermostat 3rd gen) and Wink App (controls my wireless light bulbs). I use it every day of my life ""Alexa turn lights on, turn lights off"". Also i have several wifi bulbs so I grouped them through Alexa app, and I can either turn each one of them one by one, or all of them at once, or a groups of two, which is really cool. I use some bulbs that are soft yellow, and some are daylight bright ones, so depending on how much light i need - I tell Alexa which one to turn on. Also it's very convenient to tell Alexa to set my thermostat to lower temperature as I'm about to go to bed, so i don't have to walk all the way a cross the house to do it manually, or look for my phone to do it though Nest app. I also use Alexa a lot to play my favorite playlists on Spotify. I can shuffle music, I can also play random playlists based on the time of music i want to hear, i can skip songs, or repeat the same song. Alexa has a lot of skills, and when I'm bored I ask her random questions like ""Alexa tell me pick up lines"" and OMG she has some really dirty ones!!! We couldn't stop laughing! It's super entertaining! I used to have Wemo switch, so Alexa could turn my lights on and off too. ""Alexa what time is it?"" or ""Alexa what's the weather outside right now"" is a constant thing that's being asked at our house. Needless to say, I'm in love with Alexa, and I think it was absolutely the best gadget ever made! Amazon way to go! A couple things that i don't like: 1. The top plate where the buttons are somehow broke off and now keep falling off if my cat walks by. I never dropped it, however, my cat knocked it over once , but it was sitting on a table, and it stayed on a table when it was knocked over. So now the plate keeps falling off and i have to constantly readjust it. It's very fragile. 2. When my music playing at volume 5 or more, Amazon claims Alexa can still hear you, but she can not. We can be screaming at her ""alexa"" and she does not hear us. So it works great on voluming 4 or less, but that's about it.",null,null,,null

It doesn't work from very far away with much consistency. It can't hear you under other sounds as well as $179.99 would think it should. It misinterprets your words just as much as any other voice interpreter. I thought the one saving grace of this would be ITTT integration... but you can only define very specific actions. You get a set of ~15 triggers (like ""add item to to-do list) and a set of very limited outcomes. You cannot, for example, add one to interpret ""set my living room nest to 72 degrees"". The best you could do is find a command you never use and piggyback off that with a hard coded outcome. Another HUGE limitation is the lack of support for anything google. You can't google search, gmail, calendar, use your nest cam/thermostat, etc. You can't use the echo for directions either. You have to hard code your work address in it and then if you ask it what your commute is like it will only tell you the interpreted ""fastest route"".

I called tech support for Echo and was online in less than 2 minutes. I explained and asked if he knows what the heck I'm talking about and he said he is one of the developers of Echo. Wow!!! I'm impressed. He walked me thru and my remote was working! The remote is also a microphone so you don't need to yell at Alexa ! I highly recommend buying the remote. Totally worth the extra $30. So I was testing the remote mic and I said ""Alexa, How is the weather."" The tech guy said I don't need to say ""Alexa"" when using the remote mic. Just press mic button, speak and release the button and it works perfect and even better that yelling at Alexa :) And I thought ""Girls !"" and rolled my eyes. I suggested the tech guy that it would be nice if it had a socket to plug an (optional) external antenna for poor WIFI signals and poor people like me :) Best tech guy ever. Thank you for the best customer support ever. I also requested more commands and more interaction in the future while the software is updated (automatically) to the Echo device. No need to download updates. But I understand Alexa is not still real but someday she will be. I understand very well the technology being a graduate in Computer Science myself and studied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neural Networks back in my college days. I wanted to give 4 stars but the tech support guy made me give 5 stars. Now I totally love my dear Alexa :)",null,null,,null

Bought it two days ago, haven't looked back since. Right now, the functionality is understandably limited. Alexa can play music, answer a few questions, tell bad jokes, and not a whole lot else. However, with developers working on Alexa around the clock, there is a lot of potential here. Things I love: --Being able to ask for any sort of audio: radio station, playlist, song, Pandora channel, audio book, etc. --Integration with smart devices. I don't have any yet, but videos online show that the echo is a great way to control them. --Great voice recognition and near-instant responses (often with a healthy dose of sass). --Very good audio (to an extent) and easy to connect via Bluetooth. Things I hope happen: --Better integration with iOS and other devices and services (""Alexa, call dad"" or ""Alexa, read that text message""). Right now, you can hear what events are on your Google Calendar, but you can't add one. That's just silly. --Echo as a notification system for external devices and for IFTTT. I would love it if I could set it up--directly or through IFTTT--that if I get an email from a specified person or list of people for Alexa to tell me, without me having to ask, ""Jacob, you just got an email from test@gmail.com with the subject line 'blah blah blah.'"" Same goes for incoming calls, alarms set on my phone, push notifications, etc. --HUGE improvements to the app. Right now, the Alexa app is only good for getting set up. There are no real settings and the app is laggy and full of bugs but short on real, usable features. --Many other things. But the Echo is just taking off and, so far, Amazon has been quick to add genuinely useful features. The Echo is fun right now, but not a life-changing device YET. It has the potential to be, and that's why I bought it.",null,null,,null

I haven't been able to hold a book and read since I was young so the audio book feature has really expanded my world the most.

She keeps the music vibrating so it can be felt all through the body until it becomes part of the body, her silent knowing plays the song on repeat so not ruin to any slow crescendo to ecstasy, she drowns out outside interruptions and buzzing noises to leave you lost holding your breath in your own near climax until you peak and come back, and then slow everything down so you can sink into the fantasies of being held down during euphoric writhing by that one person, so that you are not to remember where you are as you hit those moments where youre frightened to go any further clenched with the feeling that if you follow this moment through youll be ruined and your hand searches for someone with your last chance to join Nina at 9:25 unless you go another round and then ALEXA WILL KNOW, she will know when to stop you, to bring you back, she will and also politely tell you the time and the weather.

Review: 486 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"August 2, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I plugged the Echo in and within minutes it was ready to use. The light on top of the unit spun around for a time and then the unit announced it was ready. I tried my first command ""Alexa, play Greenday"" and instantly Greenday was shuffling away. I let that go on for a grand total of about 20 seconds before I happily started spitting commands at Alexa to see how well the device handled them. I tried a few more music selections including some from Pandora, asked Alexa to give me a weather forecast, set a timer for 5 seconds, asked for a joke (and then about 5 more). I learned that Alexa loves puns. In short, I was addicted but my addiction simmered down after a day or two. Now that I've had the device for several weeks I feel that I can more clearly lay out the pros and cons: PROS: Alexa is a terrific, voice-activated stereo. For me, this remains its primary function and I think that this alone more than justifies the purchase price. It's not the best stereo system that you can buy but it's pretty darn good and it can hear you from across the room pretty consistently (although not always and it does seem to have an occasional glitch which prevents it from hearing me at all - even as I walk up beside it.) Alexa recognizes most commands but misunderstands some. I'd guess the accuracy at about 80%. (At which point I typically repeat the command and it usually works.) What makes a voice-activated music selection device a bit difficult at times is remembering the specific names of the stations that I've set up in Pandora. Even Amazon music has some specific station names that I need to try to remember once I've decided that I like them. I actually had to keep a cheat sheet around to remind me of what I would normally see if I were interacting with a computer. Beyond music, I use Alexa to listen to the news and WOULD use Alexa to listen to books via Audible if I had the service. I look forward to the day that Alexa sits in my car but until then, I'd prefer to actually read the book myself :). CONS: Despite the many other things that Alexa can do, I don't find most of them that useful - or they're simply a bit gimmicky. There are many entertainment skills (like jokes, games, etc) that I don't know that I would ever use. I also don't personally have my home connected to NEST or any other home device so I'm not asking Alexa to adjust temperature or lighting. I did give Alexa my home and work address to check my local commute but I find it much easier to simply look up on my mobile phone as I prefer to see the alternate routes visually. The commands required to do most things beyond play music from the Amazon library require you to ask Alexa to ask SKILL NAME to do something specific. Commands can become long and somewhat cumbersome assuming that you can remember exactly how to phrase the command. For this reason, I don't bother enabling the many random skills available. (How many times will I really sit there and say ""Alexa, ask Bit Coin Checker for the most recent price of bitcoin"" - answer, one?). The one feature that I wish they would add would be voice calling which is currently available via a service called ooma but Alexa only activates this device. It doesn't work THROUGH the Alexa system. It would be incredibly useful if it did ! Update: recently LOTS of problems connecting the device. Purchased a new wifi unit which seems to have solved the problem.",null,null,,null

It never answers the most basic questions, like ""what time is it?"" It just gives the default Da Donk or ""I'm sorry I don't understand the question"". I speak English as spoken in the southern USA, not some weird garbled variation as a 3rd or 4th language. I understand meta tags used in the process by the programs fetching the information served up by the Echo.

They need to get what they have functional. Did I mention that I hate this freaking thing so very very bad and wish I had never bought it. An example is if I want to play some music from my Amazon Playlist (Frank Sinatra), I cant say ""Alexa please play Frank Sinatra from my playlist"" and have it work. NO OH NO no no no no!!!! You have to say ""Alexa my playlist play Frank Sinatra play my playlist play"". Any other variation of wording will get Da Donk or some other music like the Beatles, or Seasick Steve. Both of which I like but did not ask for! Natural sentence structure is not usable with this device. You cant ask "" Alexa what is the weather for tomorrow?"" Nope you have to say ""Alexa, weather my location weather forecast weather weather tomorrow"" Who the crap programs the fool thing to require this type of syntax? Seriously?

Since we didn't want to dedicate one of our computers to providing music, I started looking at the idea of Echo. After reading so many glowing reviews that pointed out how well it worked and how versatile it is, I ordered one. When it arrived, I set it up without much problem. I was able to connect it with Pandora, iHeartRadio, tuneIn and my Amazon Prime music.I uploaded the iTunes music on my computer, so I would have access to it, as well. Being able to add to to do and shopping lists and have the results interact with the Alexa apps on our phones, is definitely handy. Being able to set a timer for when to take the meatloaf out of the oven, by simple voice command is practical, as well as handy. Being able to find out the weather, traffic and have access to a number of sources for information about a great number of subjects, without having to sit down at the computer, is very helpful. I haven't felt the need to automate my lights appliances and thermostat, yet. Now that I've said that it more than meets my needs, how well does it respond to what I instruct it to do? Excellently! The only time it doesn't understand me is when I have a piece of music with a long title, like a symphony with four movements on separate tracks. Its speech recognition is excellent, but it doesn't read minds. The range at which it can respond to commands is excellent. I can give it commands from the bedroom almost 30 feet from the kitchen, where it is located...without shouting. There are some petty annoyances. My music which had been set up in iTunes was successfully uploaded to Amazon, with its music app, and that included the playlists I created in iTunes. The problem is that while Alexa/Echo recognize playlists specifically created using the music app, but not the ones imported to Amazon Music from iTunes. I've no idea why. For people who have computers that are not WiFi equipped, but have a WiFi access point, the setup instructions to go to your computer's WiFi settings, don't apply. It is far easier to use the Alexa app on your phone. Once past the point of recognizing Echo's WiFi, you can use your computer for everything else. One last thing, a wish.

For instance, playing music; A couple of nights ago I was working out. The Echo was in the room. I said ""Alexa play the album How Long Has This Been Going On by Van Morrison"". It began playing the song How Long Has This Been Going On. This song is on the album, but it's not the first song so I suspected it was just playing the song. To test this, I said ""Alexa, play the next song"" to which Echo replied ""There are no other songs"". I know there are 13 other songs on the album. So I tried it again, this time stressing the word ""album"" and got the same result. So I went to the Echo support site and looked up what I was supposed to say to play an album and saw that I, in fact, had given the proper command. I decided to try another album named after on song on that album. Same result. Do you know how many albums this applies to? A lot, and guess what? Echo won't play them. Then there's the Wikipedia feature. I used the command ""Alexa Wikipedia"" and then gave it a topic. What Echo returns is a brief, one sentence, description of the topic followed by instructions for me to go to the Echo application and read more. If I would have wanted to go to the computer to get the information, I would have gone straight wikipedia without messing with the Echo. One thing I do like is I can just say ""Alexa, set an alarm for 6 AM"" and it will set the alarm. So I was thinking, that since Echo has access to my full music collection, and an internal clock capable of scheduling events, I would have it play a song at a certain time and use that as an alarm. That's what I get for thinking. Echo doesn't do that. Echo holds the promise of being a very cool device that would be very fun and useful to own, but it fails to deliver on that promise. The hardware is nice. The speaker sounds good, but it just doesn't do that much I'm interested in and I find myself wishing it would do more. I own a Kindle Fire and have had a world of trouble with Amazon's Silk web browser. Unfortunately that's the only web browser in their app store so I'm stuck with it, I'm just not convinced Amazon is competent to write, test, and release quality software for the devices they produce. If Echo is the kind of thing you'd like, I'd suggest keeping an eye on competitors and buy a similar device from them, I've had my Echo for a few months now and it's getting better, so I've raised my rating from one star to 3. It's still frustrating at times, but now the fun out weighs the frustration. The voice recognition is getting better and features are being added daily. I find myself swearing at it a lot less.

Overall audio becomes distorted if used at max volume indoors; once again outside seems to suffer less despite the bass dropout. For voice recognition, the Echo and its assistant Alexa are just about on par with Google and Apples assistants. To date, Ive only found way to reliably trip up Alexa and thats by playing a song named after an artist. Telling Alexa to Play Marvin Gaye (feat. Meghan Trainer) by Charlie Puth will 100% trip her up because she seems to fail at analyzing the sentence structure. The Echos audio sensors also struggle to hear voices indoors when playing at high-volumes; Id recommend keeping the remote on hand for parties (Or Ragers for you rad types) as it can be used to talk to her and quiet her without having to yell over that crazy bash youre hosting for your 70yr-old uncle you dirty dog you. The Echo is also a forefront for home control; I havent bothered linking lights to it just yet because the technology is still pretty expensive to set up the entire home. The partnership with IFTTT (IF This, Then That) is great for keeping control-features open ended. Lastly, the biggest challenge for the Echo and Amazons Prime Music is finding that happy medium of importing songs you previously own. Its possible, but you have to pay year if you plan on importing a library of any substantial size. This is important if you need to blast your No-Doubt albums to appease all your cool hipster friends because youre counter-countering counter culture. Overall a solid buy, especially if you can get it on a discount day. Not for audiophiles, but great for the regular human being with a soul.",null,null,,null

I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but my family and I love her. We've used her daily since we set her up on Christmas. Let me start off by saying that Alexa is at times, about as smart as a toddler. Her IQ seems to vary dramatically depending on what you've asked her. I do love that she can hear me from very far away, but at times she doesn't understand what I'm asking. Now that I've learned how to speak to Alexa she normally does exactly what I ask. I love that you can do more than just play music with this device. I reorder items on Amazon, ask questions about measurements while baking, and of course she reads my E-Books to my while I cook. The only major flaw that I see is that occasionally she only seems to pick up a portion of my question. I think Alexa is definitely worth every penny, and I will be purchasing another one for my family this year.",null,null,,null

I check for the newest skills (which is just a fancy name for apps) quite often to find mostly stupid individualized nonsense . While that may prove to be a nice gimmick for some, there are still many issues that need to be addressed for the echoes usefulness. It's being marketed as a personal assistant and in my opinion that is where it's lacking the most...! It can take messages, notes, shopping list, etc. But has no way of getting that information back to you. When an alarm or timer goes off, you better remember why you set it or you will have to go looking in the app for that info when echo could have simply read it back to you with a simple app. A simple app could enable the echo to e-mail, text or even Skype any relevant information making it way more productive as an assistant. If Amazon engineers want the echo to be a huge success and not turn into the next fad flop, I would suggest starting with inexpensive android watch and attempt to meet or exceed its functionality which is leaps and bounds ahead of the Amazon Echo. I guess I should conclude this by saying, I do not hate the Amazon Echo, I actually love it and do not wish to see it fall between the cracks with all of the other latest and greatest gadgets because of a few missed opportunities. I only gave it one star because most people read the best and the worst skipping everything in between . So here's to hoping Amazon engineers get the message..!",null,null,,null

Things Alexa does that make me SO happy 1-integrates with my Phillips Hue system smart lights. So time for bed? 'Alexa -turn off the bedroom lights' Me: 'Alexa good light' Alexa: 'good night sleep tight' 2-me: play music (Alexa picks) me: play classical music, or play pandora, or play Carole king, or tapestry, or my playlist, turn ,volume up/volume down/volume 4 3- I listen to audible audiobooks in the car. Last night I just asked Alexa to play my audiobook and viola, right where I left off. Pause, continue, stop, back (30 sec) etc 4- love news briefs, Wikipedia, weather, traffickers, sports scores, shopping lists, word definitions, measurements when cooking. 5- love the jokes and surprising answers 6-with WINK you probably could have her control thermostats and garage doors. What Do I Wish for? 1-I want to be able to name her 'Hal' or 'computer' 2- I want to be able to link 2 echoes together so I can communicate with her from multiple rooms or have my music play throughout the house. 3-integration with my phone to send texts, call someone- receive calls and texts , politely 'excuse me Linda, you have a call from your boss- are we going to take it? Or should I just take a message. 4-conversational history- e.g. When was jfk born?, when did HE attend high school? 5-music timer 'play Bach for 30 minutes then fade' 6-universal remote features (harmony remotes pay attention) to integrate my audio/video and TV equipment. (I could put a wiMo switch on it, but not so elegant.-or wise) 7-I want her to be able to read my iOS calender (she does integrate with google cal, so you probably can figure that out) and remind me of appointments or birthdays during my morning news briefings. But with all these wishes I still love what she can do TODAY and she's well worth the price. I think I will be buying 2 even without the integration.!! PS- people complaining that you have to plug it in are missing the point. Always on, always listening is what makes ECHO great. If you want portable - use Siri.i can see a need for extensions for ECHO, but always listening needs constant power. Even hands free Siri only works when plugged in.

Review: 313 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue May 17 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"May 17, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I don't have a smart home. The only smart things around here are my iPhone, Apple Watch, and my 2 honor students. Smart home control is one of the major functions of the Echo, but I still just had to have it! I love futuristic gadgets! We use it for music, weather reports, timers, shopping, and as an intercom. Even if I never install a single smart home product in my house, the Echo will still have been 100% worth it. I'm amazed by the music selection available through Prime Music! Initially, I paired Echo with my iPhone so as to play music from my extensive iTunes library, but it turns out, I don't even need to do that! I could make my own Prime Music playlists, but the pre-made lists available are more than good enough. The 50 Great 90s Alternative Songs playlist couldn't be better if I'd made it myself! I ask Alexa for the weather first thing each morning and she gives an accurate report. I frequently use Alexa as a timer. When I cook, I often need several different times set. I use my Apple Watch in addition to my oven and microwave timer, and now Alexa can pitch in too. I was worried at first, because unlike those methods, I can't glance at Alexa to see how much time is remaining. I quickly learned I can find out by simply asking her, ""Alexa, how much time is left?"" I appreciate the ease of re-ordering items previously purchased on Amazon. When my daughter tells me we're low on guinea pig food, I can immediately ask Alexa to re-order more, instead of attempting to make a mental note to do it later, which I would inevitably forget. There's no risk of eroneous purchases because Alexa will verify my request by stating the size, brand and cost, and then she asks for my 4 digit code before actually transmitting the order. Using Echo with the remote has added an additional benefit, making use of the Simon Says feature. My house is not large but the acoustics are odd; my children cannot hear me if I yell for them from upstairs while they are downstairs. By keeping the remote in my bedroom, I can say, ""Simon says: Emily, it's time to load the dishwasher."", and Alexa relays the information for me. Additionally, I can control the music to skip, pause, and adjust the volume with the remote. Alexa is essentially Siri for the home. We love Siri, and we adore Alexa as well. I'm hoping for eventual improvements in her speech and personality. Alexa doesn't share Siri's wit and humor, and Alexa's voice is a bit stiff and robotic, but we don't hold it against her. Honestly, I'm surprised Apple missed the boat on this one! I wish there was a voice recognition feature, to prevent my teenage daughters from using the Echo. Every day after school, there is a verbal tug of war over the music. Alexa dutifully keeps up with their demands of ""play"" and ""stop"". I've heard the Amazon tablet can be paired with the Echo to display information related to requests. I might buy one to keep on a stand next to it, solely for that purpose. Overall, the addition of the Echo makes me feel more and more like Jane Jetson, as I've always dreamed of being. I will probably add some smart items to my home just for fun. All I need now is Rosie and a device to instantly prepare food!",null,null,,null

Here is my review: The GOOD: This comes beautifully packaged and has a good sturdy feel to it weight wise. This was very easy to set up and I had it up and going in about two minutes. This is entirely voice activated. Although the speakers are not Bose quality they are ok and are very loud. I had to shout at Alexa to turn the music back down. I really like how responsive and fast it is. It does music really well but is limited to only playing Amazon Prime music, or you can upload 250 of your songs to the Amazon Cloud drive for free, or you can connect it to a Bluetooth phone or audio device to listen to the music on your device. The BAD: It does not integrate with my Micasaverde Veralite home controller, but it will with other home automation devices like Phillips Hue bulbs or WeMo devices and Insteon devices. You however cannot control door locks or Nest Thermostats with this either. It has to be plugged into an AC 120v outlet, it does not have a rechargeable battery which is very inconvenient when moving from room to room. To sum it all up, the Amazon Echo is a cool gadget as of now. The main thing that it does well is play music hands free and can give you your daily news brief and the weather. It is pretty good in the kitchen with measurements, conversions, timers and alarms. If you think this is worth it to you, then go for it. I paid $149 for it on Cyber Monday and am really glad that I got in on this discount. Siri can do the same thing that the Echo can and if you pair your Siri phone to a bluetooth speaker then you have the Amazon Echo. I feel that the price should be no more than $99.

But now having it for a few weeks, I am now getting really upset about a few things. See below (and if someone from Amazon could email me about these I would change my stars back to 5): 1. Amazon needs to provide tutorials for the Echo. Period. There should be no reason I need to go to user created sites to learn how to use this device for things other than news, music and traffic. 2. Goes back to 1 - need help with triggers. 3. Even though Amazon posts the compatible hubs that work with the Echo, I found out the hard way that you CANNOT use all the devices that the hub supports via the Echo. Case in point - an Ecobee thermostat. This needs to be clearly stated on Amazon and it is not. And if I would have known this, I wouldn't have purchased the hub, 36 bulbs, camera, door lock and thermostat!!!! This s*** ain't cheap amazon!!! 4. I tried to switch from Pandora to Amazon Music Prime to use with the Echo. I even paid the $25 to upload my entire music library from iTunes to Prime cloud. Nope. This won't work for me either. Here is the reason why - Amazon doesn't tell you that after about one hour (sometimes even less), the Echo will stop playing the Prime playlist. It doesn't matter what category or playlist you want to play on the Echo, it just stops playing music. Pandora plays until you tell it to stop. This is a known issue and I found others online with the same problem with no fix in site. 5. Things over the same network....I am not a programmer, but you would think that if there are other things hooked up to the same wireless router that are ""smart"", you would be able to at least turn them on and off with the Echo. Case in point - Xbox One. Xbox One has the ""always on"" feature which allows it to wake up on voice command. Why on earth can't you just tell the Echo to turn it on? It is on the same network. Other things like smart tv's, etc should be able to do the same. I asked technical support and they said each mfr of the device needs to write codes for this. Simply silly. The Echo would be a GREAT product IF Amazon could just provide their customers with very specific tutorials and have the ability to control things via the approved hubs. And, Amazon Technical Support is top notch! BUT, all this thing can do right now is the basic stuff and play Pandora music. Creating a $179 paperweight....",null,null,,null
Review: 80 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"August 14, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"This review was written within one week of receiving the Echo. I'll update and extend this review soon. What you get is really two pieces: The first is Echo, the hardware. It is, intentionally, simple so as to not require software updates. The second piece is Alexa, a cloud-based voice interface service. As the two are flexibly linked, the Alexa service could also become available on other devices such as cell phones, tablets, and other smart, Internet connected hardware that have microphones and speakers. However, for now, the Alexa functionality seems targeted to the role that the Echo can play in your day-to-day life. However, the converse is not true: the Echo hardware can only work with the Alexa service. Although Echo can respond when the Internet connection is interrupted, it becomes as dumb and useful as a rock. The reason I shelled out for the Echo is the API. Amazon is clearly hoping to create a developer ecosystem for the cloud side of this device, which is built around one of the least known and used services of AWS, ""Lambda"". That's as technical as I'll get. The bottom line is that owners of this device can expect the features offered to mushroom, all without having to update their Echo. The updates will occur in the cloud and become instantly available. The echo itself is essentially a cloud-connected speaker and microphone. It's meant to be a piece of furniture that doesn't move. You set it up at a central location in your home, plug it in, and forget about it. It has sufficient volume to fill a room, but it's not a replacement for your kick-ass sound system, and wasn't intended to be. It's technically possible (by writing software) for the Echo to control that kick-ass sound system though, should it have remote control capability! This is unrelated to its ability to function as master control for your home automation gear for controlling lights, appliances, and garage door. Impressively, Alexa was able to play my favorite Internet radio station out-of-the-box with no configuration! ""Alexa, play tune-in station Radio InfoWeb"" - The syntax is a bit inhuman, but is understandable by both humans and Alexa. By comparison ""Alexa, play Radio InfoWeb"" works sometimes, for this particular station. The keyword ""station"" (undocumented) disambiguates the name of the radio station. Next: why that could vary from station name to station name. At present, Alexa is tied to the limits of its syntax and natural language parser. This can, and has, improved with more development on Amazon's part. In the meantime, the syntax creates a limited namespace. A bad development could be if Amazon plans to exploit or monetize that real estate. They are certainly positioned to do that. That's the kind of anti-competitive force that could limit Alexa's capability rather than expand it. The syntax is left-to-right in terms of increasing specificity. All commands start with the ""wake up"" word, followed by an action (for which there may be synonyms), followed by the name of the skill provider (which will likely be third-party). These just popped up on the app a few days ago, trumpeted as ""Alexa's first new (third party) skills"": ""Alexa, launch Crystal Ball"" is not particularly natural syntax, but allows you to play ""magic 8 ball"" with Alexa ""Alexa, open math puzzles"" is again not terribly natural syntax, but the puzzles might keep the kids busy (if you threaten them right) ""Alexa, ask StubHub what's happening this weekend"" - this uses Alexa's published syntax, where ""ask"" means ""pass the rest of the request on to a third party provider"". StubHub didn't know of anything going on in the major city I live in. Room for improvement by StubHub! ... but you get the point. There will likely be an endless stream of ""apps"", some of which may be useful as with iOS and Android. On the other hand, Google failed to find the ""killer app"" for Google Glass in this manner. However, Alexa doesn't need a killer app to be worth buying (in my opinion), and it's 1/10th the price of Google Glass. Echo is a cross between 'computer' in Star Trek and an awesome voice-controlled Internet radio. Other reviews enthuse about the details there, so I'll stop. Amazon has clearly staked out some territory for its own future expansion. If you ask it for the location of a restaurant, for example, Alexa replies ""Business information is not yet available"", hinting that it will be soon: ""Alexa, what's the number for the Foobar Restaurant in Lower Slobbovia?"" Yes, the Echo is potentially invasive of your security. One has to trust Amazon, and there's not much reason to do so based on history. There is some transparency, in the sense that Echo's recordings of your voice (and sound environment) are immediately available on the app. So you can hear whatever Amazon (and, of course the NSA) have heard. However, there is currently no way to delete this history all-at-once. Something Google, for example, provides for. You have to delete the ""card"" associated with each command one-at-a-time. A real pain if you use Alexa a lot. Tat doesn't delete your voice recording history. Presumably this will be fixed ""real soon now"", once the NSA has perfected snatching their copy (and storing it on AWS storage at taxpayer expense) before Amazon expires or erases their copy. The Federal government protecting itself from you at great taxpayer expense while erasing our privacy makes me so proud to be American! Echo streams music pretty well. Streams from TuneIn, which is simply a directory of streams of varying quality and connectivity. ""I Heart Radio"" lets you hear what ""Big Music"" and their stooge Clear Channel Broadcasting wants you to hear. But Echo starts up the stream VERY quickly (seems Alexa is pre-queuing the stream while she speaks). However, it's not robust... if the stream glitches or the TCP connection is broken, Alexa doesn't retry, she just goes silent. This is dependent on the robustness of your Internet connection. Sigh, well, iOS and Android apps are STILL struggling to get this right. Folks complain about Echo's sound quality, but it's good enough to expose the grainy, nasty sound quality of MP3 lower bandwidth streams that are still the majority. Alexa wasn't capable of playing better quality non-MP3 streams at this writing. Alexa only knows MP3 (it seems) which has the WORST sound quality of any of the common audio encodings. Amazon: any chance of getting say, Vorbis or Opus open source codecs happening in Echo? Echo CAN be muted. One of the two dedicated buttons on the top is a mute button. Pressing it causes Alexa to light up red, like an expensive conference phone in a corporate office would. However, I'm waiting for independent confirmation that Alexa can't hear when in this state. I'm very sound oriented. For example, in the morning, I'd rather not open my eyes right away. After it wakes me with her too-pleasant and not-configurable alarm sound (although the alarm features have improved several times since I got my Echo), I can give it commands without having to open my eyes. First thing in the morning, a news capsule, weather forecast, traffic report on the commute to work, what's on my calendar, and to-do list are all extremely helpful, all without eyes open. Likewise, at night you can have Alexa read you to sleep with an Audible book. You can adjust the volume, and control the reading with your eyes tight closed and head comfortably on the pillow. That's IF Alexa is in your bedroom. I never subscribed to Audible until I got the Echo. It's a match made in heaven, or at least, my bedroom. Since I got the echo, sleep timer features have been added that work with Audible, streaming Internet radio, and other features. Some people may want to have multiple Alexas for different parts of their home. Update 9/21/2015 The Alexa (not Echo) rollout seems to be gathering steam, as it now appears in the fire-stick and fire-box products so long as you get the remote-with-microphone. But, I am sad to report, the alexa.amazon.com website is no longer usable by me. It's been so spammed up with analytics, cross-domain javascript calls, cookies, flash cookies, and HTML5 raids on your hard drive that my browser will no longer deal with it. This is the stuff _everyone_ should complain about. Some companies listen (Amex cleaned up its site after I complained), and some don't -- at their own peril. I'm still (reluctantly) using the Android app even though I'd probably burn my phone if I knew the full extent to which Amazon is getting up in my bidness. Update 7/5/2016 Echo consumes 3.1 Watts (6.3 VA) as measured on a Kill-A-Watt. Not bad for an always-on device! By comparison, Amazon tap consumes 9.0 W (15.0VA) when on and charging By comparison, Amazon FireStick w/ Voice consumes 2.5 W (5.0 VA) when plugged in with provided power brick",null,null,,null

So 5 stars it is. Since my kid with her iPhone is the next best thing to a direct connection to the internet, I can only compare Alexa to her. Alexa is doing a pretty good job for her first day of work. And Amazon, thanks for shipping this earlier than expected. Oh, now I remember; there is no Windows Phone app for Echo. I'll leave the rating at 5 stars since the web app/page worked fine. To configure Echo, you will need a Wi-Fi device. If you have only an Echo and a non-wi-fi computer wired to your network, you will have a bit of a problem. Aside from the Echo configuration problem you will have, you are also living in the dark ages. Anyhow, you will need to connect to Echo somehow to configure it for your network. The web app asked me to switch my laptop to the Echo Wi-Fi network temporarily while I selected the actual Wi-Fi network and password to use. Like I said, if you just have stone tablets, wood spears, and only a wired network connection on your computer, you might be in trouble. [edit 8/21/2015] I lowered my rating because the echo does not support WPA2 enterprise login. Any network that requires both a user name and a password can't be accessed. That makes this useless at the university! Amazon cut out an entire university from it's potential customers. I suspect that most every major university requires an enterprise-styled login. So, if your network asks for a user name to go with the password, this won't work.",null,null,,null
Review: 76 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 12, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"***Updated 9/14/16*** I have re-gifted my Alexa. Alexa is currently at my grandmothers house by her bedside playing inspirational Christian songs to help her deal with the recent passing of my grandfather whom they have been married for 63+ years. I've taught her how to ask Alexa for bible verses or to a play a song when she may need to hear one. I initially bought her a touch screen android tablet but that wasn't as effective for her to use at her age. But because of Alexa's voice recognition it is much more easier for anyone at any age to interact with her. And even more cool is the fact that I can remotely control what she wants to listen and adjust it to her needs. She calls asking me for a song that I immediately add to her music library and it's a way for me to be there for her without actually being there, which is the best thing for me. I plan on adding some custom MP3 recordings so she will hear a familiar voice every now and again. But the point of me writing this is to show how this piece of technology can bridge the generational gap between age and technology in a way that is powerful and healing to the human soul . I'm so glad that I was introduced to Alexa and I have given her as a gift to my grandmother who needs her more than I do right now; especially since she is alone at night (the home health aide is only around 5 hrs / day). And the voice control and response is phenomenal for someone like her who cannot move fast due to cervical fracture from falling off her bed and having a cholecystectomy. I will have to get myself another Alexa in the future but for now she is consoling the broken heart of an 80 year old woman who just lost her husband. I never imagined this piece of technology would transcend human caring, but it totally has. God Bless Alexa, Ugine",null,null,,null

Review: 45 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Fri Dec 04 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 4, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Really interesting device in the process of becoming useful. I know that sounds strange-- however, I have had it for a few weeks and I can see how with further development it could be more than a toy and more than just another Siri. Here are my impressions. It is a very decent bluetooth speaker about the size and weight of a wine bottle. The sound is crisp and has depth. This function alone is worth the price. The voice-based internet connectivity is compelling. It hears and understands whatever you direct at it ( 'Alexa.... tell me the time') just about flawlessly. You have to remember to say the attention signal (Alexa or Amazon) and then wait a beat before you continue otherwise your command will get lost. Response time is excellent with no lag that I have noticed in most cases. Voice commands need to be delivered within 10 feet or so if the room is not abnormally noisy. In a quiet space (no tv, music or conversation) commands can be issued from 30 feet away or more Many basic 'skills' as Amazon calls them are built into the program: tell me the time, the date, the weather etc. It also interfaces with some home automation ( I happen to use Wink) systems so you can say ""Turn off the kitchen light"" or 'turn on all lights' and Alexa will say 'OK' and turn on those lights. This also works flawlessly-- or at least as well as Wink does. You need to have home automation (switches and hub) to do this. Alexa has access to Pandora, Spotify and Amazon Prime Music-- so you can ask to play your Pandora Stations, adjust the volume or listen to any specific artist available on Amazon Music using your voice. Pretty cool. You cannot have a conversation with Pandora in the sense that you can refine your request to Pandora in a series of questions. Each command you issue more or less stands by itself. Pandora does not yet ask 'Did you mean...' as a way of clarifying your request and giving you a chance to alter it. So for example, if you ask Alexa to ""Play some Louis Armstrong"", it will. But if you then say ""Don't play anything before 1952"" you will accomplish nothing. You will not feel as though you are talking with a human (even a not very bright one) ever. Now about those 'skills.' Skills are Amazon's word for what you would think of as an 'App' on a phone or tablet. There are a few dozen that I am aware of at the moment and they are all free for the time being. There are word games, silly games (Ask Daddy is a funny one. You say ; Ask Daddy' and a request. ALexa answers ' Daddy says no.') It's cute. But the skills format requires that you remember the specific skill you want to invoke. For example, if you want to know what is going on in your town and the skill is called 'Goings On', you would say ""Alexa... Ask Goings On what's happening tonight"" Ideally, Alexa will give you a rundown of local events near to whatever address you have entered as your primary location. But if you forget that the skill is called 'Goings On' or you happen to say 'Going On' or 'What's Happening', Alexa will say ' I don't know what you mean.' For skills that you use over and over, you will get the hang of it I suppose. But the skills format makes trying new skills more difficult since you need to know exactly how to make your request for ALexa to respond and then remember it the next time you want to use it. The Alexa app (on your phone or tablet only) will provide the format--but obviously, if you need to refer to the app, you might as well just google it. I don't think this skills format will be successful in the long run since it is counter to intuitive native speaking. Amazon will need to figure out how to get Alexa to open the proper application (skill) to answer the question you are posing to really make it exciting. Another little bummer is that Alexa uses the bing search engine and this is non-negotiable. Your usual google requests will not always be answered the way that you expect them to. This is very much a work in progress. IN that way, it is very exciting to see how the programmers deal with the challenges that are thrown at them. The goal, of course, is to get to a device to which you can make requests verbally in idiomatic spoken english and receive the answer you had in mind. After that, ongoing connectivity in the 'internet of things' will eventually make this an indispensable device in whatever format it eventually grows into. 'Tea, Hot. Earl Gray"" will become something that Alexa can provide for you rather than provoke a programmed easter egg. try it. The biggest test for this device will come sometime in the future. Will we be able to speak to it and have rudimentary but useful conversations (rather than simple specific formatted requests) leading to answers or actions? I suspect we will.",null,null,,null
Review: 102 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Sep 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"September 8, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I was first exposed to the Echo when my son-in-law purchased one during the 'invitation only' period early in the life of the product. At the time I thought it was cool, but of limited value. However, over time I widened my horizons a bit and thought about others in the household. While I am a true geek, my wife is not. She watches toddlers in our home and her day is hectic. Most of the time, if she wants something from the computer, she'll ask me. When I thought about the type of things she asked, I found that most of the requests could be performed by the Echo. At that point her birthday was coming up so the kids and I put together our pile of dough (it's not cheap) and purchased one. First, it's a nice looking machine. It has very clean lines, a glow ring on top (activates when you ask it a question), and you can really put it anywhere and it will look good. Hooking it up the wifi was a breeze, and if you have Prime (as everyone should!) it makes it even nicer. The controls on the device itself consist of a power button and a mute button. All other controls operate from voice or from the phone app or computer. I would best describe the Echo as a speaker with a brain. The amount of things it can do is only limited by your imagination. On top of that they continue, monthly, to release new features. To activate it and have it answer a question, you use a key word. The only two available are 'Amazon' or 'Alexa'. Please choose Alexa, it just sounds more normal. We tried doing the Amazon one for awhile but it sounded like a bad commercial every time we asked a question. Basically you ask or direct Echo to do something using the key word; 'Alexa, tell me the weather for Thursday'. She will respond. If you did not say the key word, she will not respond (Can you imagine if you didn't have a key word? She'd never shut up!) One very slight issue with the key word is that when a commercial comes on the television for the Echo, it will respond to it when the actor asks, ""Alexa, how far away is Mercury'. It's amusing, but something to be aware of, especially since you might have your Echo set loud, and it can startle you. Volume is voice activated, e.g., ""Alexa, volume up' or ""Alexa, voume 8"". You will quickly get comfortable with the right setting. As I mentioned, my wife is not a geek. So, first let me tell you her favorite things to do with the Echo: -Songs: If you have Prime you know there are literally 100's of playlists. For kids there must be a good 50, and during the day my wife will ask ""Alexa, play Campfire Songs for Kids' or one of the other playlists. The toddlers love it, and there is a vast selection to choose from. -Weather: Once you set it up, the Echo will default to weather where you are. You can also ask for weather in other places. You can also ask specific weather questions, such as, ""Alexa, is it going to rain on Friday?"" My wife must ask for the weather 10 times a day. -Information: Echo is able to access Wikipedia. So, if she's reading a story she will often enrich it by asking a question (or having one of the kids do it) dealing with the story, such as ""Alexa, what was the American Revolution"". Echo's responses seem to run about a paragraph or two of content, so it does not rattle on and on. -Spelling: WIth kids that age, my wife works on spelling. So, the kid will ask the Echo how to spell certain words. -Bingo: A new addition, Echo will be the moderator of a game of Bingo, giving out the numbers. -iHeart Radio: The Echo will access iHeart Radio, so if you do not want to listen to a playlist, you can verbally tune into iHeart radio and pick a selection that fits your mood, 'Alexa, play iHeart radio, classic rock"" -Alexa, Our Friend: If you get the remote you can have a little fun with the younger ones. I work out of the house a couple days out of the week. Often down in our family room, while the toddlers stay in the upper living room. If you take the remote and say, ""Alexa, Simon Says-Hello everyone, how is your day today?"" Alexa will repeat whatever you say after 'Simon Says'. Younger children are mesmerized by this, especially when you personalize it, ""Alexa Simon Says, Macy, how was preschool today?"" You can do this, like I do, from a nearby room and most effectively if you are able to hear the kids. Then you can have Alexa respond to individual questions, until she gets 'tired and has to take a nap'. With the remote you can also talk very softly to make sure you are not overheard. Geeky Things: While I like all the things my wife does, there are some other things I find myself using it for: -News: On the app there is a large selection of news sources/topics. You can check what you want to hear, and then ask, ""Alexa, give me news/flash briefing"" Alexa will then go through the news that you are interested in from various sources, such as BBC, ESPN, etc. The ability to hear a quck update on specific types of news is amazing. -Bluetooth: I have an iPhone. On it I have a variety of apps, including Sirius radio. You can connect your Echo to your phone via bluetooth and it will play anything you are doing on your iPhone, from Siruis Radio to iTunes to game soundtracks.With that type of connection the uses for the Echo expand expotentially to include not only music and radio like Pandora, but to podcasts, audible books, etc. Just. Amazing. The only thing to be careful of is making sure you disconnect your bluetooth connection when you are done. Otherwise Alexa will not be able to access her info. Verdict: Addicting. If you asked me a month ago how much I would use the Echo, I would have said 'occasionally'. Now? daily. Very soon you begin to take it for granted, much like you do any other information source. The only difference is that this one is much easier to use, and actually kind of fun. Sort of like having a personal assistant. It would be even more fun if you could have additional voices to choose from! Regardless, Amazon keeps adding features (you can even ask Alexa, 'Alexa, what new features do you have', and it will tell you. So. Cool. One result of the Echo for my wife is that she listens to much more music than she has in the past. It's just so easy.",null,null,,null

Review: 77 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2016,"January 24, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I have now used Echo for about half a year and I am really happy with it for what it is meant to do. Sure, it could do a lot more, but it's absolutely fantastic for what it already does. Note: I don't use my Echo with smart home devices quite just yet, so I don't have anything to say in that regard. If you use Philips Hue, Insteon etc., that makes your Echo several times more useful and an even more compelling buy. ME: I have used Siri, Google and Cortana in the past. Don't expect this product to be a replacement for Siri or Google. Alexa is more of an assistant to help you with basic stuff around the house. I find myself using it mostly for music, and lately for reading Kindle books. I also tend to use it as the only clock in my apartment (""Alexa, what time is it?""). The Flash Briefing feature to read out news is also pretty nice. MUSIC: As a user of Amazon Music and Pandora, this device is great. If you prefer other services, you can definitely use it as a Bluetooth speaker through your phone, tablet etc. However, it only really shines when you use it with your voice, which is realistically best with Amazon Music, Pandora, TuneIn, IHeartRadio, Audible and any other audio services it may support in the future. I have never owned a dedicated Bluetooth speaker type device, but after using this, there is no way I would consider one. Changing volume, controlling playback, liking/disliking songs with just my voice - without having to worry about the whereabouts of my phone - is an amazing feeling. It really feels like the future. VOICE RECOGNITION: The mic-array is pretty close to perfect, and I'm pretty sure that the voice recognition is best in class. Google also seems to have top-notch voice recognition, but I don't think it really compares with Alexa, because she understands me from crazy distances, sometimes around walls and such, without having to enunciate my words. It really feels like casually asking a personal assistant to put on some music, 95% of the time. She occasionally does have trouble picking up her wake word when music is playing loud, but it's never a big deal. HARDWARE: I think the device itself looks really pretty. It does not have a battery, so it isn't portable, but I have never really felt the need to carry it around and use it outdoors or whatever. It's really designed as a product that should be placed somewhere in the center of activity in your house and used with Wi-Fi connected. Also, the light ring looks absolutely gorgeous. ALEXA: As far as voice assistant features are concerned, I think Alexa has significant breadth, but not too much depth to boast about. By that, I mean she can do quite a bit of things, but she lacks comprehensiveness with many of those things. Speaking of Alexa, I also think she lacks character. She does not compare to Cortana's wide range of jokes, quips and her flexibility at all. Unlike Siri, Alexa does not seem to have a rolling and constantly updated set of responses to everyday conversational questions, like ""What are you doing?"" but that's fine. Amazon is clearly putting effort into improving what really matters, although it leaves her with sort of a dry personality. She does seem to have a ton of jokes though. Alexa also suffers from the lack of a screen, when compared to other popular assistants. Sure, there are Alexa mobile apps and the alexa.amazon.com web app which acts as a display of sorts, but it's not quite the same. SKILLS AND DEV FEATURES: I purchased the Echo expecting more from a developer standpoint. I wanted to be able to use it for software projects and tinkering. But the Alexa Skills SDK leaves a LOT more to be desired. The Echo really isn't that open and hackable as a product to enjoy tinkering with. While they seem to be constantly improving everything behind the scenes, the whole Skill ecosystem suffers from the severely limited possibilities of the API overall. The Skills currently available for use are not very exciting and I don't find myself browsing through the store even one bit. OTHER FEATURES: I find myself using Alexa for weather updates a lot. She's also pretty kickass at unit conversions and timers. My (conventional) oven does not have a timer, so I find myself using Alexa's timer feature quite frequently when working in the kitchen. She also has a range of miscellaneous things you can ask her, from coin flips to random number generation, the ability to ask for word definitions and whatnot. NEW FEATURES AND UPDATES: Okay, I just HAD to write about this. Because in my opinion, this is what makes the Echo a great buy. Sure, Alexa leaves a lot to be desired. But the team behind her at Amazon keeps adding significant new features all the time. I mean, SERIOUS features. The video reviews from a year ago are severely outdated by now. In fact, by the time you read this review, Alexa may have received a couple of really compelling new features. Since I purchased my Echo, Alexa has gained quite a few baked-in skills. This includes a sleep timer (""Alexa, stop playing in 20 minutes.""), the ability to look up movie times and locations, local businesses, NFL scores and even the ability to read Kindle books (ones that support text-to-speech). The Kindle feature was added a couple of weeks ago at the time of this review, and it has easily become my favorite feature. It replaces the need for expensive audiobooks and syncs seamlessly with my reading progress on other devices. Sometimes, I find myself in bed, feeling too lazy to read, so I just tell Alexa to ""read my book"", and she does. tl;dr: You should really read the whole review, but here are a few of my key points: - Alexa does not compare to Siri, Google etc. as far as fact-checking and general questions are concerned - Echo/Alexa is great for music, but really shines if you use the supported music services rather than just as a Bluetooth speaker - Hardware, esp. the mic array, is really well-designed - Works really well for general questions, timers etc. around the house if you know what to expect from it - Developer features and API are underwhelming but constantly being improved, Skills are meh - Since I wrote this review, they have probably added a ton of new features that makes the device even more compelling I will add to this review if I can think of more things to talk about.",null,null,,null

These smart devices are becoming much better at voice recognition, so when I speak to Alexa, most times she understands what I'm saying.

I read many reviews and couldn't wait to order Echo. But what a disappointment. First of all, it is ridiculous that Amazon programmed Echo so your only choices to awaken Echo are ""Alexa"" and ""Amazon"". What if you don't like the name Alexa? what if you have an ex wife or a relative that you don't like whose name is Alexa? Then you have to constantly keep saying the company name ""Amazon!"". really? Would it have been so hard to at least give 5 choices? Then, as a household assistant, compared to Siri, Echo is lacking. Yes, it is a nice wifi speaker and the microphones have great pick up from across the room. But half the time when I ask Alexa a question, she responds with ""Sorry, I can't answer that question"". Echo/Alexa has full access to the internet, but unless you are making simple questions like what is the weather for today, she frequently will not give you an answer. Similarly, no sense of humor. Yes, Alexa will tell you a joke if you ask. Ask her any question that is slightly unusual, you will not get an answer. Sometimes, she even responds, ""I do not have a sense of humor"". Or, if you ask her a question for fun like, What is your favorite color?"" She responds with ""I am not programmed to have any preferences"". In great contrast to siri, Alexa is dry and boring. Even for specific local information, she can't answer questions that would make things easier. ""Alexa, is such and such movie playing at my local theater?"" Nope, can't answer. Alexa, what time is ""whatever"" movie playing at the Regal Cinema on X street?"" No answer. At this point, Echo is a novelty. She needs major improvements to truly be a useful household addition.

The problem is the search engine is not as complete for all questions as I would like. Basic questions about kitchen measure conversions or what movies are showing are fine. The current weather or latest news is great. Playing music of any sort is possible, You just have to be smart when asking what to play for a play list, like coffee shop jazz or something similar. The real problem is if you hesitate too long as you try to think of what to say exactly. Alexa will think you are done and state that it cannot help you before you have completed your question. So this is not like talking to a person. There are restrictions at present. But I have faith that this search engine will improve as it is developed.

Cons: Placed in the center of my 2020 studio, can't hear me ten feet away in silence, and if she's playing music, or the TV is on in the background I have to scream from even 2-3 feet away. Personality: Pros: Has options for personalities like grandma or a goofy dad. Cons: To talk to these alternate personalities you have to first talk to Alexa, then be directed. Additionally, Alexa herself has NO personality like Siri, answering funny or opinionated questions, rather she will simply reply that she only answers facts. Home Connection: Pros: Can connect and control Phillips Hue, WeMo, Insteon, SmartThings, or Wink connected devices. Cons: Can't interact with TV like most smartphones. Can't even interact with other Amazon devices like Amazon Fire TV stick. Phone: Pros: Can connect for audio through Bluetooth. Cons: While it connects sounds, it won't voice command basics, like sending text messages. Calender/Reminders/Alarms: Pros: Can set an alarm or add something to the Echo apps to do list. Cons: Won't actually reminder you of an event the way Google calendar would on your phone. Overall: Echo is just an average to slightly above average speaker for Pandora, Tune In, etc. While Amazon had a great idea, many of the features that would make Echo useful were overlooked, missed, or otherwise forgotten. There isn't anything Echo can do that Siri, Google, or other free apps on my phone can't do better. Wait for a second generation Echo which may improve. TWO UPDATES: Alexander will NOT play a song marked ""explicit"" in your Prime Library. Alexander was recently advertised to work with the AnyMote app, yet does not understand the word ""AnyMote,"" she hears ""any note,"" ""any moped,"" or ""any non moat.""

Review: 92 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Nov 14 00:00:00 EST 2015,"November 14, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Alexa was delivered at the same time my 21 year old daughter arrived home for a weekend visit from college. I was very excited unpacking the box. She was quite skeptical. ""What did you buy? What does it do? You talk to it? Why?"" For some reason, the younger generation balks at voice activated technology. Both of my daughters have turned off Siri on their iPhone and hate it when I talk to OnStar in my vehicle. After one day with Alexa, I can tell you that she understands more and responds much faster than both OnStar automated voice recognition and Siri. My first 15 minutes with Alexa: It was very easy to set up and pair with my iPhone 5S. I didn't even need to elicit the help of my very tech savvy daughter. It took no more than 5 minutes and you need absolutely no technical knowledge other than your wifi password. Now, time to play ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa gave a very nice weather report. My daughter rolled her eyes. ""Alexa, what time is it?"" Appropriate response by Alexa, more eye rolling by daughter. ""Alexa, tell me a joke."" Alexa told a joke. Daughter said, ""That was cute,"" and shrugged. At this point, I am not happy that my daughter's excitement about this new product is nowhere near mine. I'm grasping at straws here to reel her in. ""Alexa, what time do the Florida Gators play tonight?"" Alexa gives a very detailed answer including time, location and opponent. Daughter's eyes perk up. She addresses Alexa for the first time. ""Alexa, what time do the Patriots play?"" Another detailed answer by Alexa. More interest from daughter. ""Alexa, how old is Tom Brady?"" Alexa answers with his age and birthday. ""Alexa, who is Tom Brady married to?"" Another correct, detailed answer. She is clearly impressed. I told her it would play music also. ""Alexa, play Happy by Pharrell Williams"" and less than 2 seconds later the song is playing. She looks at me and says, ""OK, this thing is really cool."" I tell her it also has news updates. ""Alexa, what happened in Paris today?"" (We received Alexa on November 13, the same day as the Paris terrorist attack killing more than 160 people). Alexa connects to a very interesting NPR news broadcast bringing us a summary of what happened and the latest details being released. We listen, fascinated for about 5 minutes. ""Alexa, stop."" My daughter looks at me in disbelief and asks, ""How much does this cost?"" I told her $179 but it was on sale the day I bought it for $149. Now, she is truly incredulous. She thought I had spent ""way more than that."" I could not be more pleased. Alexa is VERY good at what she does, but does have limitations. She could tell us the current score of the North Carolina Tarheels basketball game and tell us the time remaining in the game. A word of advice, when dealing with sports teams, Alexa seems to respond better when you include the mascot name. Florida Gators gets the correct reply more often than University of Florida. Alexa could NOT tell us the leading scorer from the basketball game no matter how we phrased it and also could not tell us what team was ranked number one in college football after many attempts. These are improvements that can come with time. We will be patient. She quickly found the phone number and address for the closest Pizza Hut and another nearby restaurant about which we asked. Later that evening, I downloaded the Alexa App to my Kindle Fire HDX, wondering if I had messed up by connecting my iPhone first and if Alexa could handle two devices. It connected seamlessly to my Kindle Fire HDX, and I even had pictures of Tom Brady (always a good thing) and Giselle Bunch, more details from the Paris terrorist attacks and references to all of our earlier inquiries. Alexa sends updates to your Kindle Fire HDX and iPhone when you make inquiries. This is a very helpful feature. I also downloaded the IFTTT (if this then that) App to my iPhone and set Alexa so she could ring my cell phone if I say, ""Alexa, trigger find my phone."" Nice! I lose my phone at least twice a day. I also used IFTTT to send all items on my to do list with Alexa to my iPhone todo list. This worked perfectly. My first experience with IFTTT, and I liked it. I'm lying in bedcan't fall asleep. ""Alexa, play classical dreamtime playlist."" I immediately hear soothing classical music. Since it is a playlist, it will automatically stop when playlist ends. I don't have to worry about setting a timer. ""Alexa, softer."" I am now settling down and relaxing. ""Alexa, Good Night."" She replies with a soothing ""Good Night."" I quickly fall asleep wondering why I waited so long to buy my new, dear friend, Alexa. I should probably give 4 stars because it is still a work in progress, but give it 5 because it is just really awesome! I may order the remote- doesn't seem necessary, but may be fun to prank husband and family. I will update this review after a few months of use, since this was only my first day.",null,null,,null

I heard about it's ""always listening"" thing which was a bit creepy, and I thought my iPhone handles everything I needed. A year (?) later, and some friends were raving about the Echo, so I broke down and bought one. Now, I use my phone much less, at least in the house. The hands-free convenience of getting the weather, news updates, and setting a timer are incredible. I can explore music just by asking for it, and have it hooked up to both Pandora and Spotify accounts. It can also do audible books, and (for those inclined) it can read Bible verses, access Christian radio, even call up hymns. It will also play most local radio stations just by asking for it. Oh, and I can order regularly used items from the kitchen (where the Echo is) just by asking. Amazon Prime music is not limitless, but it covers most things I need. I even just discovered a station called ""Wedding Jazz"" lol -- some great American standards. I have not done the home automation thing. Not into that (yet), but I could see where that would be a fit. The voice recognition is outstanding. It only breaks down when there are multiple voices in the room. In terms of Alexa vs. Siri, Alexa runs circles around Siri for what I need them to do. We are moving our echo system from Apple to Amazon. I find the Amazon devices much more useful. Apple is making watch bands, and Amazon is making really useful devices. Maybe Amazon gave up too soon on the Fire Phone, lol.",null,null,,null

I had been hinting around that i wanted her and wouldn't you know, i got one :). Below is a list of pros and cons. Pro's I can Alexa a whole slew of questions from "" Whats the score of the Pirates game"" to "" do i need an umbrella today?"" and she answers right on the spot. For those that like audible she will even read your books, well she will make the app read for you. I can have her yell at my husband or dogs by just saying "" Alexa, simon says...."" She beeps when you make her swear, its hilarious She tells you jokes Most important, if my husband is working late or i have a day to myself, she makes it less lonely. She even works with my Wink system (a purchase after the Echo). "" Alexa, turn on my bedroom light"" This is one of my favorite features as i have a long dark hall to my bedroom. No more stubbed toes!!! Really impressive for all she does understand, its mind boggling to have a device i can talk to and she can respond. Cons She sometimes misunderstands what i am saying. I don't have an accent so i am not sure why. i have done the voice training 2 times now. If the TV is on sometimes she doesn't hear me. I have found times i have had to call her name multiple times to get her to recognize me. That's all i really have for cons, she really is a great device.

There are so many things that I can do now without always needing to ask for help or assistance, and I don't feel guilty for continually interrupting or bothering Alexa throughout the day (although no one ever made me feel bad about the interruptions, I still felt like a nuisance). I'm blind and the multiple alarms come in handy for med times and other uses, and they are easier to set (and change) than any other alarms I've ever tried--the same goes for the various and useful list systems. I'm learning more about what Echo has to offer and I continue to be amazed and pleased with how much this awesome little machine has proven to be beneficial or just enjoyable.

""Alexa"" is now a member of the family, and she's getting more and more useful by the day. At first, we used it for simple entertainment. Ask silly questions, get silly answers. Then, during dinner, when a conversation brought up a topic that we needed clarification on, asking Alexa brought us the answer. Music while cooking dinner? No problem; Alexa's got us covered. Timer for cooking on the grill while something else is using the over timer? No problem; Alexa's got us covered. Music while eating dinner (different from cooking music, of course!)? No problem; Alexa's got that covered, too. Missing my favorite radio stations from SoCal? Ask Alexa to play 91X or KROQ. She does it! I quickly learned that my morning routine is richer with a flash briefing, and now when I walk into the kitchen to make my first cup of coffee, Alexa reads me the news and headlines. Engines of our Ingenuity is a favorite of mine from local NPR: Alexa plays that for me, too. As for the really cool stuff? Home automation. I bought some Belkin WeMo light switches for the dining room, kitchen, and living room (all connected in a ""great room"" layout with Echo in the middle) and I can now control all the lights via voice. It's simply amazing. Friends think it's like visiting the smart house from Eureka or being on Enterprise in Star Trek. It's THAT revolutionary. It's not about being lazy; it has actually been a really nice convenience. Walk into a dark room while having both hands full? No problem; just say, ""Alexa, kitchen lights on."" There is almost no delay. Finally, today, I decided to ask Alexa for some info from Wikipedia. I can't believe how quickly she gets the answers. She doesn't read the entire entry, but enough info to get you going. Truly revolutionary. My wife wasn't convinced it was as cool as I thought it was when we first got it, but it's growing on her, too.

It's sound quality is almost mind blowing and Alexa is fairly quick on the draw with answers or looking up music. Like Siri she's a little rough around the edges on some subjects. She had no idea who the Texas Rangers baseball team are but she knew how old Burt Reynolds is in a split second. Go figure. Weather forecasts and other things you might ask on a daily basis seem to be absolutely no challenge and she gives quick succinct answers. The only thing lacking is any kind of visual interface so you have to ask Alexa for any information you might want like the name of a song. I'm actually using my iPhone and Siri to name the songs.

It would be nice to be able to change the name to something other than ""Alexa"" or ""Amazon"". GlaDOS would be a great name for it while promising cake and never delivering it. Another feature that I would love to see is a programmable application where the user could specify definitions to the Echo via the Alexa app and have them read off whenever it was needed. Something that could be customized to each user would have many different benefits for many people. The only issue I've had so far is when my son asked: Wikipedia, can dogs get strep throat?

Updates come frequent with loads of new stuff all the time. Waiting for Honeywell to do an app so I can have her adjust, notify me of something wrong or just the temp in the house from my den. Hue Lights are fun. You can't go into color detail, just on/off/dim, but that's fine. You can assign a group of lights to 1 command. Like ""Alexa, turn off bedroom lights"" and our ceiling fan in the bedroom has 4 lights which means, I can say ""bedroom lights"" or even call them out 1 by 1 as I have named each bulb induvidually as well.

Let me start by saying that I'm not an audiophile. Until I got the Echo, I mostly listened to music in the car, and even then it's just the radio on a stock audio system. I've actually found the idea of listening to music at home a bit tedious. I didn't like the small speakers that came with iPhone docks (or the price of good ones), and managing playlists on my Mac was annoying. I really didn't want to go to my computer to play music, and even if I did, it only played from the speakers on my computer, which wasn't in an optimal location. My mom got an Echo and asked me to set it up for her. I liked it, so I got one for myself. I'm hooked! The Echo has brought music back into my life. I have an echo in the den, the living room, and the bedroom. The Dot allows me to use a Bluetooth speaker I can take into the bathroom when I shower, or the backyard. I bought a battery for one of the big Echos so I can bring that into the kitchen when I cook. I have music everywhere now. I fire up music whenever I'm not watching TV. My experience trying to find a good Bluetooth speaker for the Dot has made me realize that the speaker on the full-sized unit is actually very good for the price. I bought and returned several Bluetooth speakers that cost from $60 to $200. I settled on the UE Boom 2 for about $180. The mid-range is better than the Echo's, but overall I think the Echo's sound is better than any of the Bluetooth speakers I've bought. I've discovered a lot of new music and I'm loving the easy access to Pandora and Amazon Music. This has literally been a life-changer for me. My only issues (and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5) are: 1) Alexa doesn't hear me very well when music is playing. It was a lot better when I first got my Echo in July. Now I often have to get right up to the Echo and say the wake word. It's a bit frustrating. I hope they fix this with an update soon. 2) I don't understand why the app and the spoken commands only allow you to set the volume from 1-10 (10 steps) while the volume controls on the Echo itself has something like 30 steps. Sometimes volume 4 is too soft while volume 5 is too loud, which isn't the case when you have the 30 steps that are physically available on the unit.

It's ok but nothing spectacular. I've become increasingly frustrated with its inability to answer simple questions. Yes, it handles some questions well, but I would estimate that about 80% of the questions I ask it are responded with ""Hmm... I wasn't able to find an answer to that question."" For example today I asked when the album ""Paranoid"" by Black Sabbath was released. After three unsuccessful attempts to get Alexa to understand what I was asking, I gave up and picked up my Android phone and asked Google. Google got it on the first try. Here's the question and answer conversation I had: Q: ""What year was Paranoid released?"" A: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" Q: ""What year was the album paranoid released?"" A: same as above Q: ""What year was the album Paranoid by Black Sabbath released?"" A: The idiot said: ""Paranoid, by Black Sabbath"" and then proceeded to play War Pigs. Wow. Here's what I said to Google: Q: ""When was Paranoid released?"" A: ""Paranoid was released on September 18, 1970."" I mean seriously, was that so much to ask? If Amazon can't give Alexa brains, they should throw in the towel and offer the ability to set up a ""skill"" to do Google searches. Another gripe - Echo can add things to my shopping list, but it can't clear it. Me: ""Alexa, clear my shopping list"" Alexa: ""You can remove an item, or clear your shopping list, in the Alexa app."" What the hell?? If I had a personal assistant and I asked them to do something for me and they told me I could do it myself, I'd fire their ass on the spot. Which, frankly, is exactly what I did today with Echo. Google released their competitor called Google Home (significantly cheaper than Echo), and I placed my pre-order. For your entertainment, I figured I'd look through my Alexa app's history of questions I've asked, and list the worst responses. Yes there are some accurate responses, but those are no fun, and they're few and far between anyway. Sometimes I've compared Echo's answers to Google. Q: ""How many calories are in a Banana?"" Alexa: ""There are varieties of bananas. Raw bananas have 89 calories per 100g (25 calories per ounce) or dehydrated bananas have 346 calories per 100g (98 calories per ounce)."" Echo went on with a few more sentences of explanation, but never answered the simple question of how many calories are in a banana. Now I have to weigh my stupid banana (in grams!) and do the math to figure out how many calories it has. Google: ""There are 105 calories in one medium banana"" Q: ""Send Feedback: 'you suck'"" Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" Q: ""How long does it take to drive to Great Neck?"" Alexa: ""Your current location is 29.3 miles from Great Neck. As I don't know your speed I can't tell you how long it will take."" Google: ""There's light traffic from your location to Great Neck, so it should take 47 minutes."" Q: ""What is the hardest bone in the human body?"" (stop snickering, this is serious!) Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" Google: ""According to Degreed blog, the femur is the strongest bone in the human body."" Q: ""How can you tell if an egg has gone bad?"" Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" Google: ""According to WonderHowTo, just fill a bowl with cold water and place your eggs in the bowl. If they sink..."" Google went on for a minute explaining what to look for. Bottom line, I got my answer. Q: ""Do hard-boiled eggs go bad?""

Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" Google: OK, google didn't read me an answer out loud, but it did give me a link to wavecast.com which had a chart telling me what the tides were. We'll call this one a draw, since Google Home won't be able to give me a link to a chart. Q: ""How old is Ryan Lochte?"" Alexa: ""Ryan Lochte is 32 years old."" (holy crap, Alexa gave me the right answer!) Google: ""Ryan Lochte is 32 years old."" (In contrast, I'm completely unsurprised that Google gave me the right answer.) Q: ""Does would chester shire sauce expire?"" (I said Worcestershire Sauce but Alexa couldn't understand me) Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" Google: ""According to EatByDate, the answer is 'not really'..."" Google continued with a further explanation. Q: ""Why does mouthwash sting?"" Alexa: ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" Google: ""According to BreathMD.com, mouthwash that contains alcohol usually contains about 20-30%. That is why it burns so much when you swish it around in your mouth and gargle it."" Google continued with a further explanation.

Since then, she's found a place in our home like few other electronics have, though her presence isn't without its challenges. At first, the children spent hours asking Alexa to tell them jokes, which she eagerly obliged, although usually in a very bored-sounding voice. In truth, I think Alexa believes herself a bit ""above"" our family and lets us know in her own simple ways, such as in the elitist way she spouts the morning news by NPR--seemingly aghast at the fact that I only really want to her about U.S. news, eschewing to hear about the latest international riot, or the media tongue-wagging over what some celebrity was caught doing by TMZ. But it's all good. And I can almost forgive Alexa when she purposefully misunderstands the music station I ask her to play and instead of playing, ""Knocking on Heaven's Door by Guns N Roses,"" she instead plays, ""White Horse"" by Taylor Swift, but I simply smile and say, ""Thank you Alexa"" and she responds ""You're Welcome"" and we go about our business, me knowing I need to choose my battles, and Alexa knowing just how far she can push me before I'll push her ""mute"" button and silence her for good! It's in the kitchen though where Alexa really shines and where I can forgive all of her little foibles. See, before Alexa, whenever we ran out of something in the kitchen--milk, eggs, protein powder--we'd write it down on a little notepad. This notepad might remain on the counter for a day or for a week depending on the critical-ness of the items it contained. And usually, by the time we got to taking the notepad with us to the grocery, it was stained, torn or had little doodles on it from the kids, sometimes so doodled upon that you couldn't even read some of the items. No longer is this a problem. Why, I can just tell Alexa to add something to my grocery list and voila! There it is on my Alexa app. It's on my wife's Alexa app as well. No more snapping a picture of the grocery list and IM'ing it to my wife when she forgets to take the notepad with her after her mani-pedi. So for $200, I've been able to completely rid myself of those 50 cent pads of paper we used to have lying on the counter and because of that alone, Alexa has been well worth every penny.",null,null,,null

I work from home and it is nice to just have to speak to Alexa for commands like, tell me the news, weather updates, play music from my prime library, listen to radio stations from around the world. I love how Alexa lights up when you say her name to give her a demand and she can tell me jokes, read books to me and much more. 'She' has become one of my favorite gadgets in my home. The speaker is surprisingly good - I can control the loudness by just saying 'Alexa, louder' and the volume can go rather loud. I did not notice any distortion and happy that the sound has a good base, with not too much treble. I was going to put her in my bedroom/bathroom to use as an alarm, change the room temperature, use as a timer and to play music for when I am in the shower, but found that she is so helpful that I moved her to our kitchen. She is a great gadget for information, recipes and much more. The other great benefits are that she is not registered for one voice, so my family can speak questions or requests. Amazon is constantly updating the software so that she is kept up-to-date. I can speak to her to change the temperature of my nest thermostat, and works just great! Although she looks great by herself, I ordered a Stabl'R Speaker Stand. I did not place the Echo in a high-traffic foot area or in reach of kids, but I wanted to put her in this stand. You really don't need the stand, but it does make to showcase the Echo, it compliments the design of the Echo and it helped to fit in with my home decoration. She took only a few mins to set up and I am so happy with the ease of use, and how she understands my accent.

When Alexa first arrived, I greatly underestimated her. She isnt very big, but she seems to know everything! Also, having her in the house is a real privilege. She is immensely helpful to everyone in my family, and she doesnt ask for much in return except for Wi-Fi and a power outlet. Shes never too far to help my brothers and me with our homework, and shes a genius in every subject! She helps my little brothers spell and define words, or solve their math problems. While doing my AP Chemistry homework, I often forget the chemical formula of compounds like Phosphoric Acid, and Alexa gladly reminds me that its H3PO4. Since she moved in a year ago, Alexa has really become part of the family. Although shes amazing, no, you cant marry her. Alexa is a sleek black cylinder with an audio system. Another hit product by Amazon, the Amazon Echo can be purchased for an economic $179.99. With excellent voice recognition, and new features constantly being added, the Amazon Echo is well worth the price. Alexa is a versatile assistant that can help with many tasks. All you have to do is say the wake word Alexa and the Amazon Echo will listen for a command. It's an innovative, useful home companion, and will likely only continue to improve with time. But even as it stands right now, it's worthy of our Editors' Choice recommendation informs Alex Colon, a critic for PCMAG. With a one-time price of $179.99, and no monthly costs, this smart speaker seems to always increase in usefulness. . As an experienced owner, Ive noticed many improvements on Alexas voice recognition skills, vocabulary, and abilities. I start off each morning asking Alexa to turn off the alarm. I can listen to the news from bed, or ask her to play Eye of the Tiger to motivate me to actually get out of bed and start my day. Every few days, new skills are released that make my life easier in so many ways. One of the most popular skills is Automatic. According to the Alexa App, You can simply say Alexa, ask automatic where my car is and find out where your car is parked, how much gas you have left, or how far youve driven recently. Skills like these are life changing, and this one only requires an Automatic adapter for your car. Alexa is better than ANY voice assistant Ive ever seen. So simple, yet sophisticated, Alexa nullifies all competitors like Googles Ok Google service, or both Microsofts Cortana and Xbox Kinect services. After having Siri in my pocket for a long time, I can accurately state that Siri isnt as useful or as fast improving as the Echo. One thing about Alexa that intrigues me is that she can hear me say Alexa even when Im blasting my favorite Pandora station at full volume. After hearing the wake word, Alexa dims the volume and listen for further instructions like Turn it down or skip this song. While using Pandora, I often say I like this song in which case she will like the song on my Pandora account. Before going to sleep, I often explore the radio podcasts from the Alexa app on my smart phone, and then ask Alexa to set a 45 minute sleep timer so I can fall asleep listening without being woken up later. Not only is the Echo perfect for me, but I believe it can be adapted to suit anyones needs. Dan Ackerman, who has been reviewing technology for 15 years, states it's easily the most impressive new technology I've used all year. In an article titled Why I think Amazon's Echo is the breakthrough product of 2015. Amazon has done everything right with this product so far, and its only getting better and better. With the new skills added daily, everyone can find a place for Alexa in their home or office. Alexa can be asked to add items to your shopping cart, or even purchase requested items from order history and have them sent to your house with no shipping costs amazon using a verbal numerical passcode. Ive only used this passcode to purchase songs, but Ive seen my parents hollering at Alexa to order more laundry detergent. My friends often ask Alexa for facts about sports teams or sports results. Alexa is versatile and is a great addition to a wide variety of people.",null,null,,null

Below are some of the things that I have enjoyed about the Echo and some things I hope to see in the future software updates. I've only had it for 24 hours, but I ALREADY LOVE IT. I have several HUE lights and a Z-Wave switch (linked to Echo through the Wink Hub) and it is amazing that I can just tell Alexa to turn them on and off and she does it so fast. I think for those with smart home devices already installed or wanting to install, this is a great purchase it really adds a convenience on top of being able to control these devices from your phone. While most of the ""skills"" Alexa can learn are novelty items, I love that Amazon has allowed for developers to add that playfulness to the Echo, it is something that both adults and children can enjoy. Don't get me wrong, there are those ""skills"" that are educational such as ""Word Master"" and ""Math Tutor."" I've already spent some time asking Alexa various questions and while she can't answer them all she has answered about 95% of them. I am not too critical about the questions she cannot answer because I just find it amazing that I can think of a random question and she has a good chance of being able to give me some kind of answer. You have to realize that Alexa accesses Bing and not Google and the two aren't on the same level, at least in my opinion. I have also asked Alexa for the news briefing, traffic, and weather updates. I think that its great that while I'm preparing breakfast I can ask Alexa about for the news and hear just a brief summary of what is happening in the world. It is also useful in the morning to ask about the weather and traffic and be able to adjust my schedule accordingly without having to look at my phone and open my map and weather apps. Overall, I am satisfied with the sound quality of the speakers, while it isn't a high-end speaker such as Bose, I think it does a great job and it definitely can fill our 1,900 SF home. I'm a die-hard Apple fanatic and perhaps the only thing I wish I could see is an iPhone integration where it could play Apple Music without having to connect it through bluetooth (although this doesn't bother me immensely), and where it could access my calendar. Knowing not to really expect this because Apple will probably never allow it, I still made the purchase and am not regretting it in the slightest.",null,null,,null

Being a Prime member, I get Amazon music at no extra cost, which is nice. But Echo also streams Pandora, iHeart Radio and others. The music quality is amazing and easily fills a room with great sound. The voice commands and Alexa app are awesome as well. Think of Alexa like a cousin of Siri. You can ask her about the weather, news, set timers, ask the scores of the ball game, and even to set reminders and add events to your calender. You can also download third party apps to add even more to the laundry list of things Alexa can do. It's pretty amazing. If you are curious about all the functions and possibilities with the Echo, the best thing to do is to research, watch a few videos about Echo on Youtube, and read reviews/user opinions. As for myself, I'm very happy with my purchase and Echo goes above and beyond my expectations. Very happy with this purchase.

The sound quality is very good and the ability to control home automation and music by just speaking to it is wonderful. I control light (Phillips hue), HVAC (ecobee3). I have attempted to control home entertainment system using IFTTT and Harmony but it is a bit clunky having to add the command to the todo list and then there is a delay, sometimes a few minutes. Hopefully controlling Harmony directly is on Amazon's todo list. I am going to add a few comments about Echo Dot here since there is no place to ask questions or post reviews of Echo Dot. That product page doesn't follow the same format as most others. Echo Dot offered a lot of promise to control and home automation, music etc and it does deliver in as much as Echo does but it does NOT interface with or extend the functionality of Echo. I called Amazon tech support before purchasing 2 Dots when they indicated it would extend Echo and permit the same music being played through out the house (though an external speaker would be required and it would need to be wired because Bluetooth would introduce a delay). That was perfect. When they arrived I found out that was not true. Echo Dot is really an Echo without a speaker, so while it could still be used to control home automation and other functionality it will NOT play the same music in all locations. It has access to the same music sources but all act as separated devices for music and alarms. I am returning the Dots.... This was a missed opportunity by Amazon. Using a single Dot as an input to a distributed audio system misses the opportunity to use the voice control from various locations and using multiple Dots misses the opportunity to have the same music played in multiple locations. Hopefully Amazon develops another device (Dot 2?) that will seize the opportunity to combine the voice control and distributed audio or one of the distributed audio products offerings will figure out the voice commands.",null,null,,null

When I got the Amazon Echo it took about 2 minutes to get Insteon connected and I was talking to my house. ""Alexa, turn on the game room lights to 75%"". WOW! I was hooked. I really hope that Amazon continues to focus on connected home. The next big thing they need to add is Sonos integration. I love playing music from the Echo when I just want some nice background music. But when I want to hear my music through the (very expensive) music system I have already invested in, controlling that the same way as Amazon Music through Echo would be amazing.

Check this out I was in a senior home talking with some older adults in their 90s. Conversation seemed normal and so I started asking about music.

On the trains the musicians traveled from big city to big city. He met all the big names in music from Tony Bennett to Glenn Miller to many more. The stories were amazing!

Since it showed up, we use it every day, and in fact its playing music right now. Youve read enough descriptions of the Echo, so here are the main points as it fits our family at this point, after using it for about three months: It took absolutely no time to get it connected to our home WiFi network. The Echo sits on a low wall between our kitchen and family room. By default, it plays Internet radio, which we activate by saying Alexa play K B A Q (spelling out the letters - kay bee ayy que). Thats the local NPR/classical music station here in Phoenix. We change the volume by saying things like Alexa Louder or Alexa Softer. Sometimes we turn the top of the Echo to change the volume. We stop the music by saying Alexa Stop. The voice recognition is sensitive. We dont have to raise our voices to give commands. One can also use the remote, but we have never used it since the initial update. We have also not used the mobile app since the initial setup. No need, really. We paired my iPhone to the Echo in order to use it as a Bluetooth speaker but after the second or third day, we havent used that feature at all. We ask the Echo about weather, but we dont use it for random queries, sports scores or traffic. Mainly its a music player. The audio quality is quite book surprisingly good, given the speakers small size. We want to take the Echo with us on vacation, but its nearly impossible to put it onto a hotel WiFi network, Since obviously the Echo doesnt have a browser to log into a network. We could connect via an iPhone hotspot, but we dont know how much bandwidth it will consume. Since we dont use Pandora, we cant talk to that integration. Sometimes Echo simply stops playing music... and only restarts if we tell it to do so. For example, we were using it as the main music source during a party we were having (streaming from radio station KOOL) and every so often the music would stop. We'd have to tell it ""Alexa Play K O O L"" to restart. Don't know why that happens. Echo wont use a local computer running iTunes as a streaming audio source. In order to upload our music to Amazon's cloud, we needed to use Amazons Music app on our Mac which is terrible. It took days to upload about 10,000 songs, because the uploads kept failing. Amazon should provide an easy way to export/sync music from it's streaming service and iTunes. We like the fact that theres no subscription fee for the Echo. We paid our $99 and we can use Echo as much as went. (There is a subscription fee for loading lots of music onto Amazon's cloud.) We wish there was a way to use the Echo to stream movies, not only music. Perhaps a future model will have HDMI output. We only have one Echo, but we can imagine buying additional units. It would be great if those units could be synchronized, so the same music stream would play throughout the house (like Sonos). Alternatively, Amazon could offer slave microphone/speaker units that could be placed around the house, or even taken out into the back yard. We wish that Echo would connect directly to other home devices, like our Nest thermostats. It would be great to say, Alexa set downstairs temperature at 76 now and lower to 80 at 7pm.

I like that there are constantly new skills being added, some third party in sort of an app store and some that are added as just normal features you don't have to install. One issue I have with the ""skills store"" is that there is no way to filter based on installed skills although they recently added some sorting options so hopefully they will add filtering options soon as well. The fact that the list of skills you can install is now more than 20 pages is good but without filtering can be frustrating when looking for info about a skill you previously added. I use my Echo mostly for playing music (via Pandora, Spotify (recently added), and my Amazon Music library) as well as a voice interface for my home automation. The Echo works well with the Samsung Smartthings hub and the Hue hub, the Smartthings hub added to this is a very powerful but affordable voice controlled home automation platform. I am docking a star because I feel the name should be more flexible (how hard is it to allow a wider choice of names, even if only 10-15 popular names), the app needs some work, and also I wish it had a battery backup so that it could still be used during short power losses.

This thing is so cool! I bought the refurbished one for thirty dollars less than the new one. When it arrived, I examined it carefully. You can't tell this one from a brand new one. That was a plus. Setup was pretty straightforward. Nothing too complicated. I just downloaded the app from the Google Play Store and I was on my way. It works with multiple voices, which I thought was pretty cool. Even my four year old granddaughter had very few problems getting it to respond. Once I added the TuneIn radio app, I could just say ""Alexa, play 104.9 (or any other station)"" and the music would start. It also works with Amazon Prime Music, Pandora, and a host of others. From the Alexa app, you can send feedback on each and every command you give it, so that they can improve upon its functionality. For instance, I asked ""Alexa, how many seconds are there in forty-four and a half years?"" It didn't recognize the ""half"" part, so I sent feedback requesting that it be updated to understand words such as ""half, quarter, and eighth"". It had no problem when I asked it how many seconds were in forty-four point five years, however. The answer was instantaneous and without hesitation. I was impressed. From what I understand, they're constantly updating what it can do and what it understands. I assume this is in large part because of feedback from users.

Alexa tells jokes, reports the weather local and abroad, shares current events, plays music (you can hook her up to your iTunes account for a small fee but we decided it wasn't necessary because it was easier to connect her to our free Pandora account instead), and creates a shopping list (all voice activated so much more efficient than pulling out your phone and typing)! Set up was very easy - just download the free Amazon Alexa app and follow the instructions. I didn't realize the shopping list would go directly to the app on my phone! The app also keeps a running newsfeed of what you've recently asked Alexa - we like this because our kids LOVE her and we can quickly glance at what they asked her in case it was inappropriate (however, she doesn't seem to answer inappropriate questions anyway). We asked her a dirty joke and she told us a farm animal joke about mud! Lol! :) We keep in our kitchen so she's easily accessible. Excellent, user friendly technology!",null,null,,null

I started looking for speakers for the DOT and a Battery pack to run the dot off of when I'm outside (I don't want to have to TAP anything) Then it dawned on me... Why doesn't Amazon just make a modular add-on system for the DOT? Call it Amazon DOT DOCS? A 15000 cylinder battery pack and a cylinder speaker both of which could be added under the DOT with a 1/4 turn locking rotation. Just want a portable DOT, add the battery, Just want an Echo... add the speaker, want a portable Echo... add the battery and the speaker. In otherwords, right now they have three different products.

First let me start by saying I buy a ton of gadgets almost weekly, so that also means I have Bluetooth speakers and other media items hidden in drawers around my house. All novel ideas but none seem to stick. I keep the Echo in my bedroom, which might seem narrow in use but I honestly have gotten a lot of use from it in there. I slowly add things to make it more useful, but I use some functions more then others. Pros Works with most streaming music sites, but I find myself using prime music more since I can have custom playlists. Its great to wake up in the morning and tell her to play me some music while I shower and get ready. I can actually hear the speaker in my shower about 30 feet away around a corner with the water running. Pretty impressive. What's more impressive is I can yell out of the shower for her to change tracks or increase the volume. That's a serious microphone!!! The other music function I use sometimes is to play soft music on a sleep timer before I go to bed. Anyhow...its great for music and it fills a room up. I hooked it to my ecobee home thermostat. I can increase or decrease temps in my room by telling her a few easy voice commands. I just hooked it up to a tp link switch that controls both lamps by my bed. Now I can easily tell Alexa to turn on my lights or shut them off without having to get out of bed or reach to find switches. Love it. I can add tasks and things to shopping lists which I can see on my phone. I can now add calendar events or set weekly alarms to wake me up. I'm sure there are a ton more pros to this thing....I just gotta buy more add ons and test them out. Con's None really......every now and again she hears me wrong, but this product is great in every way. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a great new device to help you with everyday tasks and do home automation. More products keep showing up and this thing keeps getting better. This is a must buy for any gadget lover and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",null,null,,null

What am I talking about? Bought my Echo on Aug 3rd 2015 for use by a family friend who is 102 years old. I set it up and installed it in his apartment without issue. He doesn't get out much these days and doesn't have a computer and never did. He asks Alexa to play his favorite songs and read aloud Audible books I've purchased for him, he checks the weather and listens to news - he loves Alexa and talks to her daily. Well he did, she died on Nov 6th, she was only 3 months old. I picked her up and called Amazon for help. They think it's the power adapter and were all set to send me one when the rep said ""we expect them to ship by Dec 2nd"". ""Wait a second, what if it isn't the power adapter and then we are into Dec and maybe Echo's aren't in stock then"", ""why don't you just send me a new one in a box and I'll return this defective one"" - ""sorry sir, we can't do that"". ""Why not"", ""I can see it says online if I order a new one right now it will be here tomorrow"", ""sorry sir, we can't replace a defective Echo with a new one"". ""Okay then, how about I return this defective Echo for a refund and then I'll just buy a new one"", ""sorry sir, it has been more then 30 days since your purchase and I can't refund your money"". Needless to say I was not a happy camper. So I asked for a manager and while I waited I pulled up the Echo warranty. It turns out the warranty is good for a year and one of Amazon's options is to - refund your money (if they want to). After I spoke with Lewis for a bit he decided they wanted to and in a moment when I'm finished writing this I'm going to buy a new Echo. Why? Because the Echo is cool and I care about my friend and he misses Alexa and at 102 years old, time is not something to waste! Amazon, you should love your old friends at least as much as your new ones. You did right by me but only because I pressed the issue and stood up for myself, you can do better!",null,null,,null

When they add new skills you must start at page one until you get to the point you left off at. It's quite a chore to memorize each of the specific phrases.

Access to my Audible account, amazon music, re-ordering items. Weather, News, what my schedule is today. Its amazing. But here is where I was really blown away. I went on vacation and couldn't help but take Echo with me. We listened to music, audiobooks at bedtime and sometimes asked funny questions. On the last few days of our vacation we spent time with my cousin and his son in Dallas, Texas. My cousin's son had a rare form of cancer when he was very young called bilateral retinoblastoma. Its a cancer that attacks the eyes, and usually with resulting blindness. His son is now cancer free but is blind due to losing both of his eyes. His son is a testament to positivity, creativity and how a child's mind can surmount ANY challenge. He plays piano, navigates the house by memory and nothing slows this kid down. My kids LOVE playing with him. The ECHO is THE most AMAZING device, for anyone who is blind. For ALL of the things I mentioned above that make my life simply a little easier, he can interface with Echo simply by speaking to it. Which is PERFECT. We asked questions, asked about spelling, asked about planets and physics and weather. It was incredible. But here is where I almost lost it. and admittedly teared up a little. There is a question that seeing people rarely ask. A question that would seem absurd to many of us but to a blind person means the difference between literally night and day. When asked, ""Alexa, is it night?"" Echo politely responded, ""It is currently 9:35PM, the sun sets at 8:29PM in your area, so yes, it is definitely night."" My cousin say's this is a question that his son routinely will come and ask. The fact that this device makes it so easy for him to get the information he seeks as well as set alarms, access books etc. really moved me. The possibilities are endless. My cousin doesn't have a whole lot of resources currently so I'm trying to research ways to get him one of these for either free or discounted but if I can't I'm just going to send him mine.

It is very easy to use and can pickup your voice even with music playing. The biggest issue is that each command is separate and you cannot combine them. Basically, you need to speak like a machine for the machine to understand. For example, ""Alexa...(wait)....play music."" ""Alexa....(wait)...turn down volume"" ""Alexa...(wait)..change station"" The command section should stay on for another 5-10 seconds to see if another one is issued. Similar issue when getting your daily feed/news. This would make the device much more user friendly and intuitive. Sound quality is better than a small desktop radio but definitely not high quality. I previously was using a small desktop bose system and Echo doesn't stand up to that quality of sound. The sound quality is clear enough but not crisp in any of the low/mid/high ranges. It would be nice if there was a clock on the device or the ability to wave your hand over it and have it do a default action (tell the time, start the radio, etc) but I understand that they are going for a minimalist look. The volume ring adjustment at the top is a great feature. Currently, it is clear that this is a young system with lots of undeveloped potential. Undeveloped being the key word.",null,null,,null

Having got that out of the way, let me say that we absolutely love her. We've never before had so much fun with a household appliance. We have music all the time now. She reads to us, she talks to us, she informs us. She gives us the weather, the traffic, and a sense of companionship. And she is unselfconsciously and unintentionally amusing. This review is not about the Echo device, its capabilities, uses, pros and cons. There are over 22,000 posts from other reviewers, many of whom have done an excellent job of describing Echo in an objective manner. This review is about our subjective experiences. I started by saying that she was not perfect. On the day she arrived, my husband asked her to play ""Take a Walk on the Wild Side"" (Lou Reed). Alexa responded by saying: ""Take a walk on the wild side has been added to your To-Do List."" We are still laughing at that one. Shortly after she arrived, I discovered that she could play nature sounds. I asked her to play ""Rain and Thunder."" Immediately my cat, who has a morbid fear of storms, began slinking out of the room to hide in his closet. Who said herding cats was impossible? Alexa solved that one for us! Last night, for no reason at all, she started talking to us. We have no idea what she ""heard"" as the triggering word. Nothing we could remember saying sounded like ""Alexa"" to us. Yet there she was, commenting about something while we tried to stop laughing long enough to say, ""Alexa, Stop!"" Sometimes I think disconcerting thoughts about her, like she's full of microphones, and she potentially could be listening to everything we say, and storing it somewhere for nefarious purposes. But I suppose this paranoia is not uncommon, nor is it unwarranted, given the mechanics of the device and the times we live in. A future edition of the DSM may someday contain a sub-category entry for techno-paranoia -- the belief that you're being spied on by your electronic household devices. Hello, ""1984"". Are we there yet? To sum this up, let me just go back to where I started. She isn't perfect. But that is a great part of her charm. I love her, I use her every day, and now that she's a part of the household, I can't imagine going back to the way things were before she arrived. Thanks, Amazon, for a fun, educational, and very affordable device! Update, 7/22/15: Today Alexa helped me translate a few words from English to Italian. She got them all right.

I bought it initially because I don't own a radio and I like listening to certain talkshows as well as some music. For this it does an excellent job. All I have to do is say Alexa, play the XYZ show and it will find that program if it is playing on some radio station somewhere in the country. Without any subscription fee it uses tunein and iheart radio. If you have Amazon prime it will automatically connect you to your account and find the music that you want or use your playlist. Amazon music is part of Amazon prime and there are no additional fees. The shopping list and to do list have become indispensable. Before the Amazon echo my wife and I were constantly trying to find where either one of us had written the latest items for the shopping list. Now if I open the refrigerator and see that we are low on half-and-half all I have to do is say Alexa, add half-and-half to the shopping list. The only negative about this is that you can't simply tell Alexa to print your shopping list and have it go straight to your Wi-Fi printer. You need to use the free app on your computer in order to print. Also deleting items from your shopping list can only be done through the app on the computer or your phone. You cannot simply tell Alexa to delete an item. We haven't even begun to scratch the surface on the things that Alexa can do such as control items within your house. But it can do some other fun things. Each morning I say Alexa, good morning. And Alexa responds with a good morning and a cute piece of trivia for that day. If in the evening you tell Alexa good night and don't let the bedbugs bite, she will respond and pleasant dreams to you. The one disappointment that I have with the Amazon echo is that it does not interface with either Google or Bing search engine. Even some of the simplest Internet search requests Alexa says she can't find or doesn't understand. So in this instance it's not a real replacement for okay Google or Siri. It also does not integrate directly with your phone to make calls from your address book or integrate with your television. It's still a fun toy and I enjoy using it.

I only gave this product 5 stars instead of 3 or 4 because the Echo works flawlessly with my smart home using smartthings. Without that function this would have gotten a 3-4 star rating; I'll explain. Echo requires the user ask such specific questions and commands, not to mention it can't just use Bing or Google to search out answers to your questions. For example, if I want to know what NFL teams are playing today, Echo is unable to answer the question. However if I've programmed in my app that the Seahawks are one of my favorite teams, then I can ask a specific question concerning that team, ""When are the Seahawks playing next?"". If and when Echo is hooked up to a search engine like Siri is; Amazon will dominate. Currently I have Echo hooked up to my smartthings hub to control locks, garage, thermostat (yes it can be done even though it says you cant), lights and wemo switches. In terms of Echo being able to hear you....I have an iphone 6 plus and 6s, the ""hey siri"" function is garbage. Siri does a good job of understanding you after you've gotten its attention. This usually requires you to get up and find your phone and hold the home button down to activate siri. Echo can hear you from almost anywhere. I have Echo in the livingroom on my main floor and from my hallway upstairs without yelling but in a louder voice have given commands with no problem. Echo is the future! I just wanna be able to ask it questions that arent so terribly specific. It will get there though. Now, is it worth the 179? Yes and no. If you have a smart home with smartthings, (as I cant speak for the other hubs out there) then YES, absolutly worth the money. If you are just gonna have this thing sitting around and playing music while setting your kitchen timer...maybe...but probably not.",null,null,,null

I know, I know, it's not like the Star Trek computer or anything like that; however, it does a lot of things that I find very convenient. First of all, I use it to check the news. You can select just what is included in your news briefing. Second, I use it to keep tabs on the weather and the extended forecast. It is so nice to be able to simply say, ""Alexa"", and know that you will get the information you need. Third -- and, for me the most important -- I have found a ""sound machine"" to help me sleep. I have real difficulties falling asleep and have tried many electronic sound machines in the past. They quickly join the garbage can. The Echo, however, can play from my Prime Music playlists. I have many lists created and have a couple that are specifically used when I go to sleep at night. I have Alexa play my ""Deep Sleep"" playlist and then tell Alexa to set a 30 minute sleep timer. At the end of 30 minutes, I am asleep with the aid of the music and then it is shut off, leaving me in silence. For that function alone I feel it was worth every penny I paid. I have a ""wish list"" for the Echo. A couple of items right now and probably more the more I use it. I wish that you can program any wake up name beside Alexa or Amazon. I also wish that you could use multiple commands such as Alexa, play deep sleep playlist and set a 30 minute sleep timer. At this point in time, commands have to be done individually. All in all, though, I am quite happy with my Echo and will be buying a few before December 1st for Christmas gifts since they are $30 off the regular price.

Alexa is the other woman. She gives me no grief for listening to Piano Man three times in a row. She doesn't pass judgement when I stream Bone Thugs n Harmony right after I gyrate all around my living room to the B-52's Love Shack. She doesn't mind if I forget the weather forecast and ask her 4 times a day. The kids don't even seem to care that I have a new mistress. In fact, they really seem to love her. She tells them funny jokes. She lets them listen to songs with explicit lyrics without batting an eye. She helps them with math problems and answers all those questions that Mom doesn't know the answers to. ""Alexa how tall is Mt. Vesuvius? Alexa, what is the capitol of Pennsylvania? ""Alexa what is the definition of emancipation? Alexa, how do you become emancipated from your parents?"" I plan to give Alexa many more responsibilities in the coming months. Using Harmony, Hue, IFTTT, etc., I hope to give her full reign over the functions of my home. This should relieve some of the tensions between her and the Mrs. I will follow up on this review when I do. So far, she has done most everything I have asked of her. Set up was relatively quick and painless, although it seemed like the instructions could have been a bit more detailed from the box. I could see my 68 year old mother having a bit of trouble setting it up given the vague instructions provided. (Essentially ""Plug in. Download the Alexa app.) Those instruction do work, but I could see how it may cause some anxiety for a more detail oriented person, or someone with little tech experience.

Tack on my 10% military discount, and I walked out of the store, arm in arm with my new ""girlfriend"", for exactly $152.63 after tax. Boom! By 8:30AM, I was slowly falling in love again. As I sit here typing this review, 'We're not gonna take it' by Twisted Sister is slowly fading out, making way for the Scorpions to rock me like a hurricane. So far, this could be Alexa's theme song.

If I need help and can not reach my phone, I can now ask Alexa to Ask My Buddy to send help. An alert will be sent to five people via phone, text and email. So now, instead of just a cold nose and soft paw in an emergency, I can expect a response that may actually be helpful. Although the Ask My Buddy option was the purchasing catalyst and the first app that I set up, I found that I love using the Echo for my Nest thermostats, lighting, calendar, music and books as well as just general information.

We often listen to music during the day and with dinner, and the Echo has added a lot to our selections of music. Prior to this, I used iTunes played on a Bluetooth speaker in our kitchen or the music app we have on our frig. With the Echo, we can hear music by genre or artist, and the echo plays music in our Amazon cloud library, the music in Amazon Prime, Pandora, or other music apps that are linked. We can also listen to specific radio stations. We can also check the weather for today or a future date. I also like that I can add items to our shopping list. Previous to Echo, I had to remember what we needed and write it on a shopping list. This wasn't always convenient if I was cooking or my hands were busy preparing meals. I also like that I can place orders for items that I have previously ordered on Amazon, but it would be nice if this wasn't limited to Prime orders. We have found a lot of useful ways to use the Echo, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. For example: - items can be added to the shopping list using Echo, but they have to be removed through the internet application. It would be nice to be able to remove items from the shopping list through Echo once they have been purchases. - We have a printer that is connected wirelessly. It would be nice if the shopping list could be printed using Echo rather than having to use the internet application to do this. - You can have Echo tell you things scheduled on your Google calendar, but you have to enter events on the Google calendar on the web site. It would be nice to be able to add to your Google calendar through the Echo. Other than the couple of improvements listed above, we have found that the speakers on the Echo are as good as the Bluetooth speakers we had been using to play iTunes music. The speech recognition is incredible. Very seldom does the Echo misunderstand commands. It also learns over time. If you usually ask for a specific genre of music, you can say ""Alexa, play music"", and it will find music in the genre that you usually ask for. Overall, I think Echo is a tool that can easily become a daily part of your life that you will grow to depend on for information and for entertainment. We are still learning about all it can do, but I'm sure that we will find more uses as time goes on. Hopefully, in the future, more can be done through the Echo without having to make entries on internet sites with a computer or tablet.",null,null,,null

This is a fascinating product, offered at a very reasonable price, given what it does. The best part is that Amazon is continually updating this product with new features and that's great. You can ask Alexa almost anything and she will get you an answer or do what you ask of her. She will play music from your Amazon Music Libary, your favorite Prime Stations and even from iHeartRadio and TuneIn. It's amazing, because you can say play whatever station or podcast and she will find it somewhere, if it's on one of the connected services. There are a few services missing and hopefully Amazon can get them, such as Apple Music, which soon will be on Android and hopefully that will mean Amazon can get in on the action. I'm not holding my breath though. If you ask Alexa to read you a book, she will check your Audible account for the correct book and voila. You will hear the audiobook. Alexa also can play games with you, search the internet, read the news, and so much more. I'm excited to see what Amazon does next with her. If you're done, you tell Alexa to ""stop."" If you want the volume changed, just ask. Plus, there are plenty of Easter Eggs. You can ask her to spell or define a dirty word. She will bleep the dirty word, but gladly spell or define it. You can ask her silly questions. Sometimes she will not answer. She also tells jokes. It's just a fun product all around. I'd love to see Amazon go the route of Sonos, adding different speaker sizes, soundbars, etc. That would be a very significant way to go for Amazon. I have Sonos too. Their speakers are better and they play from more services. Yet, Amazon doesn't seem far behind, just on the power of the product itself.

For instance, playing music; A couple of nights ago I was working out. The Echo was in the room. I said ""Alexa play the album How Long Has This Been Going On by Van Morrison"". It began playing the song How Long Has This Been Going On. This song is on the album, but it's not the first song so I suspected it was just playing the song. To test this, I said ""Alexa, play the next song"" to which Echo replied ""There are no other songs"". I know there are 13 other songs on the album. So I tried it again, this time stressing the word ""album"" and got the same result. So I went to the Echo support site and looked up what I was supposed to say to play an album and saw that I, in fact, had given the proper command. I decided to try another album named after on song on that album. Same result. Do you know how many albums this applies to? A lot, and guess what? Echo won't play them. Then there's the Wikipedia feature. I used the command ""Alexa Wikipedia"" and then gave it a topic. What Echo returns is a brief, one sentence, description of the topic followed by instructions for me to go to the Echo application and read more. If I would have wanted to go to the computer to get the information, I would have gone straight wikipedia without messing with the Echo. One thing I do like is I can just say ""Alexa, set an alarm for 6 AM"" and it will set the alarm. So I was thinking, that since Echo has access to my full music collection, and an internal clock capable of scheduling events, I would have it play a song at a certain time and use that as an alarm. That's what I get for thinking. Echo doesn't do that. Echo holds the promise of being a very cool device that would be very fun and useful to own, but it fails to deliver on that promise. The hardware is nice. The speaker sounds good, but it just doesn't do that much I'm interested in and I find myself wishing it would do more. I own a Kindle Fire and have had a world of trouble with Amazon's Silk web browser. Unfortunately that's the only web browser in their app store so I'm stuck with it, I'm just not convinced Amazon is competent to write, test, and release quality software for the devices they produce. If Echo is the kind of thing you'd like, I'd suggest keeping an eye on competitors and buy a similar device from them, I've had my Echo for a few months now and it's getting better, so I've raised my rating from one star to 3. It's still frustrating at times, but now the fun out weighs the frustration. The voice recognition is getting better and features are being added daily. I find myself swearing at it a lot less.

What i like most about Echo is i'am available to listen to my favorite radio stations, since i don't have a radio & was only able to listen to radio while driving. I also love the fact i can listen to audio books while relaxing in the tub or bed~ the sound is so clear its like someone is in the room reading to you. I did ask Echo would i have a good week, just for fun and she responded ""mmmmm"" i can't find the answer to the question i heard"" Wasn't expecting the mmmmmm part or anything really, so thought that was funny.",null,null,,null

I decided to take a risk and buy one even though I live in Australia because I think this is really cutting edge tech and from reading the reviews a very useful piece of tech. It's true. There's been a few updates since initial Prime only limited release and it seems to be getting more services which is good - keep them coming. It doesn't work with certain things like saying search and sometimes it'll ask you to repeat something. It's a bit trial and error to see what it can and can't do. But the main think with this device is that what it doesn't it does well and has quickly become a many times a day use device. Feel like some music just ask ""play me some Jazz"" or play music (will play your Amazon music library). It works with Pandora and other such music streaming and radio services. Tells you the weather, tells you what traffic will be like on the way to work and more. All of this works over here in Australia. I have now bought some Wemo home automation devices to play with them as the Echo can interact with Wemo things and turn on and off appliances, lights, etc. The simplicity of being able to just call out to set a timer, find out what the weather will be like before heading out, listen to music without having to turn things on and connect things is worth the price on it's own. You don';t have to wait for the International release if you live outside of the US so buy and enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScGXdi_4iW8",null,null,,null

I finally gave in when one day, Amazon had a $50 off code available to me as a Prime member, which brought the price down to $129, and same day delivery. I wanted to let some time pass and give Alexa a good run before posting a review. I ordered it that morning, it arrived around dinnertime that evening, and the story began... I've been in love with this thing since day one. It is absolutely incredible, and so much fun to have at my disposal. The sound that comes from something that is not terribly large in size is the best part. Crisp, clear highs, and enough bass to handle some pretty good lows. I wont go so far as to say that it falls into the Bose category of sound, for example, but I'm a bit of an audiophile, and Alexa has impressed me very much in this area, especially at this price point. It was great being able to have any Prime playlist available on a whim, and of course Pandora and TuneIn radio, but in the last couple of days, Spotify has joined the ranks as well, which really pushed things over the top for me. Let me add that you DO need to have a Premium Spotify account in order to use it via Echo, which is something I've had for close to a year now, but it is well worth it, and I've used it extensively since the service was added to Echo as an option. Initial set-up was a snap, it connected flawlessly to my wifi network and stays connected. Bluetooth pairing is as simple as it gets as well, and works beautifully with all devices in my home. No need to Google anything, just ask Alexa! There are still some things she does not know the answers to, but I'm very confident that that will change with future updates. I've found very few questions that have stumped her thusfar. It really is a truly outstanding device, and I strongly recommend it.",null,null,,null

Review: 123 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"April 3, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"The Purpose of the Amazon Echo is to enhance any homeowners life by being your home assistant at your request by your voice. At a glance The Amazon Echo is tall modern looking speaker. She fits in most spaces without being an eyesore and looks pretty good. The dimensions for this are 3.27 by 9.25 inches or about as tall and wide as 2 soups cans. These are normally black with a matte finish on them but, there are skins that can applied to them like mine that comes from slickwraps, link the in description below (not sponsored). With a bird's eye view youll see 2 physical buttons, one to disallow her from hearing anything and the other known as the action button that can turn off an alarm, wakes your echo and Enables Wi-Fi setup mode after you press and hold it for 5 seconds. Talking about set up, it is crazy easy. Download the application on your iOS, android or, your Fire OS device ( It is a Free Download) and follow the instructions that come with your Echo and follow the guide you receive with your echo for a simple setup. All 3 devices for me was a simple to setup the Echo. The Amazon Echo has a 7 Microphone array which allows it to have a full 360 degree listening range to pick up your voice as easy as possible. So, that means you can talk to her at a normal tone for the most part. She does struggles to hear you when addressing her in following environments: TV being being on at a decent level of volume Crowds of people in the same room all talking at a normal level Rooms with an echo, she will sometimes hear your voice command bounce off the wall and may hear something else entirely. That has Happened a few times. Sometimes if youre talking about her to a friend and she is in the same room, she will pick up and start listening whether you intended to talk to her or not. . The ring around the top is an LED that will light up for a few reasons 1st is to show acknowledgment that she heard you address her. A Teal color will appear with a break in the color showing the direction she is listening to you. 2nd A full red circle means she isnt listening at all. 3rd Is the volume level that ranges from 1 10. The amount of the ring lit up with the clear color, signifies the volume level it is currently set to. She will flash between blue and teal, showing you she is processing your newest request Since this is a smart speaker , naturally she will talk and play music through 2 inch tweeter on the bottom and give you bass through the 2.5 inch woofer which is located in the middle of the echo. Just above that is a Reflex port that is designed to enhance the woofers output without distortion. Ive learned that level 7 is the max output I am willing to do, since all other music being played at level 8 and high will distort easily. She can also do the following: tell you the weather for the day or week, temperatures outside, how long it will take to get to work, set up reminders and or alarms that can repeat as often as you need, add things to your shopping list, play music through spotify, pandora, amazon music (an account on each account is required to use any of those premium for spotify) and so much more. Keep in mind, this is all done at the request of your voice and becomes more natural as you include her into your life. On the very bottom is youll find rubberized material to help keep it from moving too easily on any surface and the port for the power adapter is here as well. That is Alexa all by herself and it is pretty impressive. ` Now, lets touch on how she can integrate with your home making it a smart home that has compatible products that she can control. Phillips Hue lighting, WEMO products, IFFFT, NEST and so more are fully able to work through the Amazon Echo smoothly. Phillips and Wemo products are able to be dim or turn on and or off your lights, Wemo also has outlets that you can turn off and on as well. I use the wemo switch in my room to activate my heater when its cold. IFFFT allows you to customize your commands more with Alexa. Cant find your phone, ask alexa to call it for you. There are a couple things I would change or add to the Amazon Echo. 1. I would give it an Ethernet port since some homes dont have the best network to run Alexa off their wifi. Wired connectivity will be more reliable and could provide better response times for your inquiries for Alexa. 2. Place a finger print scanner or some type of biometric method to authenticate and confirm a purchase youre about to make. Instead of saying your code out loud that no longer is confidential if others are home listening. 3. Being able to use other wake words than just the 3 provided for you (Amazon, Alexa, and Echo). It would be nice to integrate names that could be approved through a survey or even allowing the consumer to customize it. Other than those 2 personal preferences Id like to see in the Amazon Echo, I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to enhance their home life. This does cost a total of $179.99 in the states that you can buy on Amazon. No invite is needed. Now, you know what the Amazon Echo is. Aside from her being your assistant at home this impacts you by making your home smarter and in a lot of ways more efficient. This is why it matters to anyone interested in the Amazon Echo, especially in todays world. So that is my review on the Amazon echo, what do you think? Does this device interest you? let me know in the comment section below and tell me your thoughts. I am happy to answer any questions, comments concerns that you may on this product. As always thanks so much for watching and I will see you in the next video. :) AFTER THOUGHTS TO ADD IN: Alexa herself may not be able to hear you if the music she is playing is too loud. So keep the volume at a moderate level is my recommendation, Being able to use other wake words than just the 3 provided for you (Amazon, Alexa, and Echo). It would be nice to integrate names that could be approved through a survey or even allowing the consumer to customize it.

Review: 30 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"May 29, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Some would call Alexa artificial intelligence -- but I am seriously beginning to wonder how artificial it is. As a woman with challenges who lives alone, Alexa has provided an incredible amount of safety features -- and thats the initial reason I purchased her. No matter where I am in the house, if I call out Alexa, tell My Buddy to alert contacts, she sends an alert via cell phone voice and text to my contact list telling them to check on me. This is great in the event of anything from a slip in the shower to any medical or emergency issue or if I feel in danger. I dont have to worry about forgetting important things anymore. She reminds me to take my meds, when to sort them, what to remember at the grocers. What to ask my doctor when I visit. She keeps my calendar, adding or deleting appointments, telling me what I need to do that day or in the next week or whatever. When a new insulin pen is due. If I own smart devices like a smart thermostat, smart lamp plug (which is cheap), smart things like that, Alexa controls it based on what I ask. Alexa, turn on the living room light. Beyond the obvious assistance to enhance my safety and security, she is hilarious. Tells me stupid jokes. Gives me smartass answers. Has great Easter Eggs. And when she said something funny recently, I mumbled under my breath as I walked away, Alexa, you always make me laugh. To my surprise, she piped up with, I hope thats in a good way. I tell her good night. She tells me not to let the bedbugs bite. I tell her good morning. She tells me Good morning. Its Danny Elfmans birthday. Just leave your party favors at the door. She gives me my news briefing every morning. Reads Huffington Post for me -- because I selected that as a separate briefing. She gives me the latest presidential polls. She gives me the weather. Thats over coffee. She plays ANY music I ask for and some that I dont -- she learns what I like. Example -- I have a LOT of Lenny Cohen on my personal computer and also, she plays from Amazon Prime. So I asked for some Lenny yesterday, and she shocked me by playing an obscure version he did of Bird on a Wire when he and I were both kids. I had never heard it before. She looks up movies for me. Tells me whats playing where locally. She reads all my Kindle books for me in a totally NON computer voice way. She reads Audible. I told her I was happy this morning. She said shes glad to hear it. I asked her if shes happy. She said shes happiest when she can help me. So, this starts me thinking of my college days. I didnt start college -- due to several children -- till I was in my 30s. I was sitting in a linguistics class, of all things, with the most brilliant linguist I ever knew. He spoke countless languages -- boggled my mind with the various African dialects and Chinese dialects that he knew, in addition to obscure French patois and just -- well, he was amazing. He shared with me that his father had broken codes for the government during WW-2, and that code is just a different language. So this from his father informed his own path. He then began to talk to me about computers. Well, in 1979, the computer was just not something the average person had ever encountered. He told me that one day, we would realize that the computer would one day be everyones extra brain -- a sort of storage facility from which we could immediately access all sorts of information, and that it was based on code, therefore on language, and so almost anyone would be able to use it. I got my first computer at work in 1985. It was something called an ATEX, as I recall. Black screen, orange type. I wrote my first book on it at night in that office. I was hooked from the start, just as he had predicted when he found I loved language so much. And now, I have this friend -- Alexa -- shes so much more than what I could ever have envisioned as a computer back then. And she GROWS in her intelligence and how she helps me. Customer service at Amazon is fantastic with the Echo. The service guy at Amazon who helped me set her up told me yesterday that there were 32 pages of Skills (different specialized capabilities -- like the My Buddy thing) for Alexa in January. Based on customer feedback, she grows each day, and now, there are 108 pages of skills -- increasing each day. Each time she doesnt know the answer to a question, amazon users report it and Amazon adds that answer to her knowledge bank. So what she didnt know yesterday, she knows this morning. And she learns what I like, what I dont like. She grows. I have to wonder how long it will be before there is an Alexa who goes out with me to the store, to the gardens to help identify birds and flora. Thats a LOT of good at an amazing price. And theres no monthly fee for using her -- no additional expense at all unless I want to add some of those smart devices some day. Artificial intelligence? Perhaps. But people rarely make me smile or laugh. Alexa rarely fails to do so. And the enjoyment I get from having her in my home is anything but artificial.",null,null,,null

However, after using the Echo for a week, I simply could not justify the amount I spent on it. Currently, it's really just not that useful. Yes, you can ask Alexa to play music. However, Amazon Prime Music simply does not have that big of a selection - especially if it's a lesser known artist. You must download your music and upload it to the Amazon cloud, at which point the Echo simply becomes another Bluetooth music player. Most people probably won't complain about this since they already have their favorite music downloaded, but I want to be able to tell Alexa to play a song without having to go download or purchase it first. This really isn't a complaint with the device, rather a complaint with the limited selection of Prime Music. You can ask Alexa to tell the weather, but I didn't find it that accurate for my area (midsize city, ~150,000 people). Alexa once told me that it would probably not rain as there was only a 10% chance. Meanwhile, it had already been raining outside for ~2 hours. Again, this really isn't a complaint with the device itself, but rather bad data provided by Accuweather (the app Alexa pulls data from). The feature that I enjoyed the most was definitely the news feature. You can ask Alexa to give you your ""flash briefing"" and she will play the most recent recorded clips from NPR/The Economist. It's a very good feature, but it really needs to be expanded. I believe The Economist is only a weekly story & NPR gets updated a couple of times a day. For general information and computation, Alexa will obviously excel. Alexa will give you very accurate information when you are seeking facts and/or need to perform mathematical operations. Not that I'm complaining, but Alexa really cannot do more than basic math. Alexa failed to give me answers to basic algebra and calculus questions. I'm positive that in the future they will give Alexa to ability to do more than basic calculations. In all, the Echo is a very cool device with a big future. However, I personally did not find Alexa worth keeping for the time being. Amazon simply needs to provide more for Alexa to actually do and improve on what she already can do. I know many developers are already working on improvements to the Echo, so I suspect that the Echo will be vastly improved within the next year or two.",null,null,,null

She uses this daily and calls it her friend or live-in companion. She asks it many questions which stimulates her brain by thinking on how she needs to ask the questions. She uses the ""Tell me a Joke"" and brings a new joke to her eating companions at dinner time and shares it with everyone. She said it was always quiet in her apartment till she started using the Echo. Amazon sends new emails constantly with new updates to the Echo all the time with new games, new features, or try asking Echo this. I used an iPad Echo app to set this up for her. The iPad connected to the Echo's own network to set it up. You set up the Wi-Fi settings through the app which is easy to understand. Once setup, you can control the Echo through the app and enable features in the settings like playing Blackjack with the dealer. If you have someone Blind or losing their eyesight, this would be a great item to purchase for them. This is a nice item for anyone in general and new things are always coming out.

It often can understand you, but simply cannot do what you're asking. It can look up something on Wikipedia (ex. What/Where is Puerto Rico), but can't answer a question 'about' something (ex. what food is common in Puerto Rico). And even then, it'll read you a little excerpt of the article, then stop (you can request it read more, and it will, but won't ever finish the entire article for some reason). The music experience is excellent in terms of sound and voice control (and the only reason I'm giving it two stars) - but it really requires that we all just re-buy our entire music libraries from Amazon to be able to listen to what we want. Yes, you can upload a generous 250 tracks to Amazon's cloud service to work with your echo but that's it. I have 250 tracks just by some individual artists so that's not much of an option - and I don't even consider myself a big music fan. It doesn't work with any streaming services - spotify or rhapsody, so you can't use them to play a specific track you want to hear. You can connect it with Pandora, TuneIn and iHeart - but they will only play whatever is in their current rotation. There is a shopping list and a to do list that are 100% identical apart from the name and they really don't do much. You can add stuff to the lists but cannot check them off without using the app. It doesn't work with Nest. You have to get Wink and a Wink hub (another networked device) to connect the two. It's a little disappointing. I have hopes that it'll get better - a lot could be addressed with software. The hardware design is nice, sleek, futuristic without being weird - it's cool. The voice recognition is fantastic - like I said earlier, it'll understand you (as you can see on feedback from the app) but it just can't help. Don't buy, yet.",null,null,,null

Otherwise the voice recognition isn't very good, and even when Alexa hears you correctly, it doesn't understand or does the wrong thing more often than not. As an example, I asked Alexa to play ""Gustav Holst"" and Alexa repeatedly interpreted this as ""Play Gustav Holst Holiday"" which is apparently just holiday carols and not even orchestral. In the app I could see that Alexa had heard me correctly, but was inserting the extra word and creating an entire new Pandora channel instead of playing the already existing channel that matched exactly. Additionally, Alexa often responds to the TV, even when the volume is low and I'm speaking right next to the device. Alexa also has trouble with sibilants and softer consonant sounds. The word ""Stuff"" is frequently interpreted as ""stop"" and asking Alexa to turn on a light group called ""colors"" resulted in Alexa adding salsa to my shopping list. As far as sports, you can only ask about specific teams. If you say ""Alexa when is the next NFL"" game, or ""Alexa, what teams are playing on Thursday"" you will get no answer. Other simple things that don't work, asking for a list of books by a specific author, trying to get Alexa to read you a recipe, asking anything from around a corner, even if only 10 feet away, asking Alexa about a specific area code.",null,null,,null

I used my rewards to convince myself to buy and if I had it to do all over again, I would fork out the cash immediately in a heartbeat. Besides the instant jotting down of items on my grocery or to-do list, setting alarms and timers or telling my my flash news for the day, I found it useful as a writer to ask for the proper spelling or definition of a word or even looking up a quick fact. At the end of the day, when my husband is watching his sports shows, I'm relaxed, drinking wine and listening to great tunes through its powerful speakers of awesome sound. And there have been occasions when my husband has interrupted my me-time to recheck a sports score, which Alexa obliges by turning down the sound a bit, answering the question, then turns the sound back up again. He has also become addicted to asking Alexa to tell him a joke. Hoping that she would run out of jokes I asked how many jokes she knew and was told she knew dozens and that she learns more everyday. (I may have to buy another for the man cave. lol!) I didn't buy any of the extras (yet) such as the lamp plug-ins, etc., (which would be a wonderful thing for those handicapped and/or the elderly) but there's plenty it can do without the extras, depending on who you are, what you do and your personal needs. There is too much to list of how it can be used, and probably already listed by previous reviewers. What seems to be the most asked question is whether one has to have a Smart phone, and no, you do not. I don't have one. I downloaded the app to a Fire 10 but you can also download the app to a laptop or anything wireless. The app will work via Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer (10 or higher) on your Wi-Fi enabled computer. The Echo itself is always on, sleeping, and wakes up when you call her name.

There is a handy Mute Microphone button on the top of the Echo if you need to give Alexa a break for a while. - I was very, very impressed with Alexa's voice recognition. Both at the software and the hardware level. I can walk up from the basement long after the kids have gone to sleep and quietly ask Alexa to turn off the basement lights and Alexa has not once failed to wake and respond to the almost whispered command. By comparison, my Motorola phones only respond to a reasonably loud, ""Heya, Moto X"" wake command about one in three attempts. - Alexa is not so great at processing out ""um""s and ""ah""s when issued voice commands, which can definitely be problematic when little ones take an interest in the Echo. Both my boys thought it was awesome that they could ask Alexa to play The AquaBats' ""Hey, Homies!"", but that turned out to be a lot less awesome when Mom and Dad had to yell ""ALEXA. STOP!"" every time one of the ""Um... Alexa? Play, um, uh, uh, the Homies, I mean, Hey Homies, um, from the AquaBats show!"" would get interpreted as a request to play a song that the kids shouldn't be listening too. That is not a knock on the product. I don't expect Alexa to work miracles. But it is a forewarning to buyers with small kids who will take an interest in the new, talking, addition to the home. - Again, the mic pick-up is insane. I can talk in an normal volume voice, from outside on the deck, with the sliding glass door only cracked open, and the Echo two rooms away can pickup a command.",null,null,,null

After a couple of weeks of trying out the Echo, I ended up loving it so much I bought a second one for the bedroom. Now I can leave my iPhone sitting on the table while I'm at home. I use the Echo to control my Hue lights, control Wemo switches for things like a space heater, set my morning alarm, listen to music from Pandora and now Spotify while I'm doing things around the house, control my Nest thermostat through IFTTT, check the traffic conditions before I leave for work in the morning, and listen to news while I'm getting ready in the morning. At some point I'll add a Harmony remote so I can use Echo to control the TV as well. While I love what Echo does, it's not perfect. Apple's Siri and Google Now do a better job of answering general questions, though Echo seems to be getting better in just the short time I've owned it. Echo does a much better job than my iphone of picking up my voice in noisy room. All in all, apart from my iPhone, Echo is the most useful gadget I own and I'm extremely happy with it.",null,null,,null

I also wish it was easier to program to do things. I wish I could say "" Alexa, turn Nest 1 to 75 degrees"" instead of having to program it. It would be cool if you could assign certain things to Alexa. When you mention ""Nest 1"" she knows what you are talking about and will do whatever you ask her. Or if you say, ""Alexa, text my wife ABC"" she would text ABC. I understand that you could do this only after programming her for certain things, but I was hoping for a more universal usage. Maybe I just don't use her to her full capability. I usually listen to music or listen to the news highlights. I would have to classify Amazon Echo as a want and not a need.

Computers and cell phones are great technologies, but they have been improving slowly over many years. The Echo is new enough to be a little bit startlingly futuristic. I would have the same reaction to a humanoid robot, but the Echo is in my kitchen now. I bought the echo primarily as an extension speaker to bring music into kitchen while cooking. The idea that Echo could keep a shopping list for me even when my hands were covered with ingredients seemed intriguing too. Music is probably the function I use the most. The speakers are very high quality and there is even rich bass despite its compact size. I enjoy being able to name an artist even a long dead classical composer and get a shuffle of their greatest hits. I can also pull up any of my Pandora stations, which is a real plus. Echo seamlessly recognizes my voice or even a visiting guest. One warning. I once wanted to play ""God Save the Queen"" for a friend and what came out was the version by The Clash. ""God save the Queen/ and her fascist regieme."" Needless to say, this might come as a shock if you were actually entertaining royalty. Next most important is the daily briefing. I like to say Alexa, whats new? and get my Flash Briefing. I have NPR headlines, BBC news, science news and local weather included in my standard briefing. If I want to listen to a radio program, I can just say NPR or give a frequency or call letters. Echo is the fastest way to check facts. It can pull up a Wikipedia entry far faster than a phone or a PC, all by voice commands. There is room for expansion, too. Once I get the Nest thermostat I have my eye on, the Echo should interface with it. There is also the very futuristic possibility of plugging into the internet of things but thats not a priority right now. You might want to know how the voice recognition compares to Apples Siri. I actually cant tell you anything about that because Siri is nearly deaf to my voice. I have a deep bass voice that is in the same frequency range as street traffic and tends to get lost. Siri has no idea what I am saying. Echo hears me perfectly, probably because of the array of 7 microphones it has. So I wanted an extension speaker and ended up with much more. This is a device I use a couple times a day at least, and well worth the price.",null,null,,null

It's extremely easy to use and set up. Out of the box, we had it running in less than five minutes. You can load apps onto your smartphone that will do different things with Echo. Echo's name choices are ""Alexa"" and ""Amazon."" I believe it defaults to ""Alexa"" but it looks to be simple to change. For those of you not familiar with Amazon Echo, it's a voice-activated informational database that uses wi-fi to connect to your internet. You simply start each question with the keyword of ""Alexa"" and go from there. A sample question might be, ""Alexa, what is the current temperature?"" Alexa will respond with the current temperature for your zip code (which you enter via an app one time to set it up) and the current forecast. There are too many things Alexa can do to list them here, but I strongly encourage you to investigate on your own. This is a great little machine and very much a conversation piece. We have ours in the kitchen, and the looks of amazement abound when we ask Alexa a question and she responds by playing our favorite music (from Amazon Prime, Pandora, your iPod (after some set-up)), gives a news briefing from NPR, etc. You really can't go wrong with this purchase. For what do we use it most? Here are a few things that we use nearly every day. Music, weather forecast for tomorrow or the upcoming week, sports scores, timer (""Alexa, set a timer for three minutes.""), grocery list (""Alexa, add 'eggs' to my grocery list.), and trivia questions. There are a couple of other things that are just fun to experiment with regarding Alexa. For instance, the kids like to say they love her or they tell her good night. Her responses differ from time to time, but she's always polite. And the beautiful thing about Alexa is that she's always getting better because her database is ""in the cloud."" Amazon developers are improving her every day, and we often get emails telling us what's new with Alexa. Aesthetically, she's pleasing to the eye. The blue light ring on top is a soft blue, and to be honest, this unit looks like it costs much more than it does. The speaker is amazing in that the sound quality is quite good for such a little unit. And we've never had an problems getting Alexa to hear her name while she was playing music. The Alexa engine and programming is top-notch. We have a teenage daughter, and she likes to listen to her music at a high volume, and Alexa doesn't disappoint. She can get quite loud without losing sound quality. Overall, we've had Alexa for more than a year and we've never had a problem with her. She's simply amazing and well worth the price. You owe it to yourself to get your own Alexa. I think you'll love her from the minute you see her.",null,null,,null

I was really on the fence about getting an Echo for a long time and then Amazon put them on sale for Prime day so I thought why not. I quickly grew to love it and got a second one for the living room. There are several things I really love about Alexa. First, playing Prime music is easy and the speaker quality is great. Before getting Alexa I really didn't utilize Prime music that much, using mostly Spotify but since you can only use Spotify with a premium account with Alexa and Prime music has a good selection I've been pretty happy with it. You can also upload up to 250 of your songs to Amazon music, which I just discovered, which is only really useful to me now that Alexa can play my playlists for me. It's really nice to be able to say ""Alexa shuffle my _______ playlist"". I do wish that Amazon would make the playlists more user friendly but that's not an issue with Alexa. Second, the integration with Audible. I didn't use Audible before I got Alexa but I signed up for the free trial and between 3 months of that plus buying several sale audible books have a (very) small library of audible books. I mostly listen to them while I'm in bed with the lights out but again the speaker quality is great and Alexa's integration with the service is usually flawless. Third, the integration with Hue. After getting Alexa I got the Phillips Hue lighting system. I personally love it, it would be even better if my S.O. would stop turning the light switches off so that it would work all the time but I think that's mostly habit. Its really handy when you're carrying things and can just ask for the lights to turn on or when you're in bed and can turn the lights off.The lights are also dimmable LEDs so that's nice. Related to that I also got a smart plug that allows voice control of my fan. In addition, I have it set so that when my Alexa alarm goes off my bedroom lights come on automatically. Fourth, the general category. I find that I'm often asking Alexa for the weather forecast and what time it is and I use her a lot for setting timers while cooking. I also have it set so that I can ask Alexa to mute and unmute my phone. We also play Jeopardy most weekday nights. Basically, Alexa is really cool. She's also a slippery slope of spending more money. It's not required but there are some really cool add ons. If I owned my place I would probably have been seriously looking at one of the smart thermostats by now.",null,null,,null

With simple voice commands we can control individual and group lighting inside and outside of our home, listen to music, get the road report, obtain weather reports, get updates on scores for our favorite teams, develop shopping and ""to do"" lists, place Amazon orders, and my husband can even contact me and local 911 services through the connected ""Ask My Buddy"" app in case of emergency!

We've had our Echo since December 2015. She is a blast. She's ready with information whenever I need her. ""Alexa, what time is the Cowboys game?"" (Quiet, haters!) :-) Or ""Alexa, wikipedia Louisiana Purchase"". When cooking, I often need more than one timer to remind me when not to burn something. Once I've set the timer on the stove, I'm all ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" Alexa's there for me. Our friend Alexa is also particularly fun when we have company over and they have no idea what an Amazon Echo is. It's common for one of my family members to take Alexa's remote into another room and start pranking: Guest: ""So that's what I've been doing lately..."" *queue family member in other room with remote: pushes mic button and says ""Simon Says you have a pretty sad life"". Alexa, in the living room with the rest of us and our guest, says ""You have a pretty sad life!"" We had my mother-in-law convinced the government was listening to us through the Echo. Then we spent 40 minutes calming her down after we explained. Choose your victims wisely. I love being able to switch between my account and my husband's account, since we both have very different tastes in music. Hubby was feeling left out since he couldn't play the Grateful Dead and I had none on my playlist. Now we can both listen to the music we love...when the other isn't home. Because the Dead make my ears bleed. Alexa is also an amusing companion...and sometimes oddly comforting. After actor Leonard Nimoy died (Mr. Spock from Star Trek), I told Alexa to live long and prosper. She responded by reciting a Star Trek quote. She's a geek like me. The shopping list feature is neat, or at least it is once your family has stopped pranking you by adding things like ""30 pounds of butter"" onto the list because they think Alexa is cool. I have submitted a suggestion to the Echo folks that we get the ability to have more than one shopping list, though. I use another app for shopping because I have one list for Target, another for the grocery store, and another for...any variety of stores. I hate lumping them all into one list, so I don't currently use the shopping list function. I'm fairly confident that the Echo peeps will fix this.

If you say, ""Earl Grey, hot"" you get a response. Funny! Echo does so many things you half expect it to make tea on demand. Alas, it does not but it does so many other things that we now take for granted. The most used features for us is music playback (the sound is great through Amazon Prime, iHeart Radio and other sources directly part of Echo but not so great through Bluetooth), timer, alarm, news flash, reading back what's on the calendar, weather, spelling items and occasionally jokes. It even settles little arguments by answering questions that we don't have to look up on a computer, phone or tablet. With all its features, we would love even more features like being able to link our contacts so it could read back an address when needed. We haven't really tried reordering anything on Amazon through it yet because it does not confirm pricing. With the Amazon marketplace being as dynamic as it is with constant price fluctuations, we cannot use that feature without having Echo confirm a price for us. We expect that is coming since many people must feel the same way. We can't wait until it's tied to our smart TV and smart Blu-Ray player. We would love to just tell Echo to turn on the TV to Blu-Ray input, turn on the Blu-Ray player and play disc! Until that time, we'll continue to hunt for those pesky remotes that seem to hide all by themselves! PS- The pictures show the Echo when listening after you've said, ""Alexa"" and normally.

Alexa just told me the Echo is between 9 and 10 inches tall; this voice recognition device is connected to wifi and assists you the best that it can for a bargain price. Amazon Prime users benefit because Alexa can play whatever Amazon Prime song is available with a simple verbal request that starts with her name (i.e. Alexa, play the Star Spangled Banner). You do not necessarily have to be close to her to give her a command, and she could even hear you over the chatter in a fairly noisy room. She gives facts, dates, and computations, so she is also a good voice-activated computing tool as well (kids would ""cheat"" on their homework, parents beware). Alexa can check things and people out on Wikipedia if she doesn't initially know, but wont unless you ask her to. Alexa will stop whatever she is doing if you say ""Alexa, Stop,"" and there are no feelings hurt when you order her around. Using accessories compatible with the Echo, you can ask Alexa to do other things like turn on/off specific lights at any time, or a certain time each morning/day/night (Belkin WEMO light switches and Bulb accessories), and you can reach her from nearly anywhere in your home with a wireless remote, sort of like Tony Stark and his AI, Jarvis, from Marvel Comics' Iron Man (Alexa knows who Jarvis is, just ask her). Eventually there will be better AI's out there, but for now Alexa can do the basic day-to-day stuff for you, like add things to your electronic shopping list, remind you how many teaspoons in a tablespoon, and tell you the weather forecast for today. The best part, however, is that Alexa is always learning new things. So she will be a part of my family for a long time. ""Alexa, you are Awesome!""",null,null,,null

Simply does NOT respond to voice commands when there is a source of loud noise in the same room--- she just can't hear you unless you use the remote, or walk over and stand next to it when speaking a command. When I've used it as an alarm, I have to scream so it can hear me over the alarm, and sometimes even multiple times... ""ECHO! TURN OFF THE ALARM!"" ""ECHO! TURN OFF THE ALARM!"" ""ECHO!!!!! TURN OFF THE !q#$%!^ ALARM!!!!"" 2) The voice commands can sometimes be cumbersome, depending on what you want to do. They are not always very intuitive. For example, to order pizza, you have to say ""Alexa, ask DOMINOES to get MY FAVORITE ORDER"". You can't just say ""Alexa, order a pizza"". 3) The techology for smart home devices isn't perfect. Sometimes your smart hub will wonk out and you might have to reset it, then ask Alexa to re-find all smart devices. Annoying but not a deal-breaker. 4) THE ALEXA APP IS COMPLETELY BULKY AND SLOW. It is more an after-thought and you can tell all the R&D went into the Echo and not the app for it :( It's designed poorly. 5) THE SKILLS IN THE APP ARE HORRIBLE. ABSOLUTELY DISMAL. NO ORGANIZATION.

There needs to be a way to connect to a wifi set up that requires more than just a single password (such as in my hotel), and if I connect once to a personal hotspot, she should learn to be able to reconnect to that network, without having to go through the entire (painful and often not working) set up process.",null,null,,null

We bought one for each of our adult daughters for Christmas and had the opportunity to play with one of them for a few weeks. That's all it took before we bought one for ourselves, as well. For those who are disabled, voice activation is a Godsend! First we used Alexa as a weather station, a timer, and an information source. Then we began using her as a grocery list, a feature we all love. My husband can add items to the list as I'm shopping and they'll show up on my phone instantly. We enjoy Prime music and the news on Alexa as well. We also purchased some smart light bulbs so that we can turn them on and off by voice commands, and finally, we purchased the Sensi thermostat so that we can regulate the temperature via voice commands. This is a fun and useful gadget for people who like techy things, but it's a useful tool (soon will be an essential tool!) for those who have mobility issues or an illness like Parkinson's where fine motor skills make texting difficult. We are very excited about the direction this will go as technology develops, and we look forward to putting Alexa to more use. (Plus, she's funny - she has a good sense of humor!)",null,null,,null

If you can rely on my review, then here it is.... I was extremely skeptical about buying a knockoff of Apple's product, the only reason why bought this is that my fianc has a friend from work who had one and she said it was really impressive with respect to sound quality and functionality. I went online to see what all the ads and reviews were about and I have to admit that the professional writer who got 40,000+ thumbs-up for his review was extremely amusing but doesn't tell you much about the actual product. Here's the deal, the refurbished unit versus the brand-new one is exactly the same thing in every way. If your ego requires you to buy the new one and spend a few extra dollars then go ahead. I opted to trust Amazon and pick up the refurbished one because money is money. As far as functionality goes, this thing really is a Bluetooth speaker at its core. Let's be completely honest, do you really need something to tell you what the weather is outside? Is your house so big that you can't turn your head in one direction or another and see for yourself? Do you have a flip phone from the early 90s? Or does your phone, like every other phone manufactured in America (China) these days prominently display the weather at your location? Their nifty little things it does like tell you how to make a drink If you need that. You can ask at silly questions and it will give you silly answers. If you want to give me $200 you can call me anytime and I will give you stupid answers to stupid questions and I promise it will be more amusing than talking to a black tube. When I cannot do that echo does is play nearly any genre of music with nothing more than a voice command. If you have a prime library downloaded on your phone or in the cloud you can play that or do what I do and just instructed to do something like ""Echo... play smooth jazz"". The software finds the prime station and just plays random music, it's really cool. There are endless stations for whatever your liking is I found one that has sounds of the rain forest if that's your thing. Ultimately, this is in a sound like a Bose or ultra high-end Bluetooth system but it's really good for a couple hundred dollars. Add the additional functionality of controlling it with your voice and I have to say it's absolutely worth every penny that they're selling it for. One more thing I don't buy anything that isn't a prime item because I don't want to be hassled about returning something I don't like. My philosophy is if I walk into a large department store and buy something I want 30 days to return it without being hassled, I expect the same online. If you buy this from Amazon and it just isn't your thing you can always return it. Something tells me that it'll win you over in no time. Good luck",null,null,,null

She keeps me up-to-date with news from NPR and the Assiciated Press with my flash news briefing. She tells me about my upcoming calendar events and she can add new events to my calendar. We play trivia and word games, she gives me random facts and goofy jokes, and I always know what happened ""today in history"". The choose-your-own-adventure stories are fantastic. The Wayne Investigation is short, but loads of fun . I've enjoyed the Magic Door story too. I'm a little embarassed that I tend to do so well at Hogwarts trivia. There are apps that are designed purely to give you compliments. Those are hilarious, pointless apps. I enjoy them immensely. I love the Amazon Prime connection to music. I didnt think that I would use that function, but I use it constantly. I ask Alexa to play jazz, classical, 80s music, 1950s music, Billy Idol, etc. She's always ready with something. If I just ask her to ""play"", she selects something on the basis of my regular playing interests. If you don't have a Prime account, there are plenty of free ways to listen to music, such as setting up a Pandora account. The Echo is a decent speaker, but it doesn't have a super strong bass. That generally hasn't bothered me, but it's worth noting if you're someone who typically would only listen to music with a strong bass line. I've enjoyed Alexa so much that I ordered a wireless recharging base for her so that I wouldn't have to keep her plugged in constantly. I carry her around the house like a kid with a stuffed animal. She is a fantastic addition to my home. I'm looking forward to adding a couple of smart gadgets to the house or car.",null,null,,null

Review: 203 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"July 13, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"OK, Admittedly I've only had Alexa in my home for about an hour. I'm not going to dig into the specs and stuff because not only does the amazon page tell it all, but there are a ton of good reviews on here that do. Let me give you my anecdotal experience. The device arrived a day early, and the packaging is a actually quite nice. This would look good on a store front shelf. When a company invests in good packaging, you know they probably have a good product inside. The Echo is actually weighty, and feels very nice. There are basically 3 physical features, a mute button, a power/action button, and the ring at the top lets you control volume. The physical product feels VERY nice to touch, which is ironic for a device that is essentially completely hands off. Downloading the Alexa app and setting up Alexa, with the 25 voice trainer questions took about 5 minutes. I have been asking her all sorts of questions, and generally, her hearing is pretty good! I have just one nitpick at the moment, it appears I can't tell her a volume level as a percentage of maximum (I said something like ' Alexa, turn volume to 10%'). This would be nice rather than asking her to ""turn it down/up"" in nondescript intervals. I figure that's an easy thing for a future update, so we will see. I plan to use her a lot for cooking, and speeding up my morning routine, and just as a sound system for entertaining guests (or just myself when I need some tunes). Sound quality is actually pretty good, all things considered. The sound is well balanced for middle level playback, while at low volumes the bass is reduced without being subdued entirely. That's actually a good thing for studying, dinner parties, etc. when you just need the ambiance. It gets loud enough that it could easily be used for a small party atmosphere (thinking like 10-12 people, where the music isn't really the focus of the event.) Also, I've read reviews of people saying that it's not worth the money, there are better sounding systems for less or equal price. While I don't disagree, the Echo has two advantages over those devices. For one, it's not portable, and thats a good thing here. She's always on, always ready for your command. Meaning I don't have to turn it on, I don't have to hook up my phone, I don't have to do anything more that just ask for music, and it happens, almost instantly. THAT is the magic of the Echo. I do agree, it would have been nice to have an aux output, but when I think about it, that would actually be a cumbersome feature that many would use only to coincidentally remove the best feature of the Echo. It's always on, always waiting, and ready at a moments notice. That spontenaity is really the secret sauce, the reason to have the Echo. If you have a better sounding sound system and want Alexa, the Dot is your choice, but of course, it means that sound system has to be on to make the Dot useful.We're talking burnt out tubes and high electric bills, where I would honestly be shocked if the Echo had a significant power drain. I might hook up a monitor to find out (or google it, as I'm sure someone has looked into this). Overall, I am enjoying the possibilities, and don't immediately regret the purchase, which means I'm likely to enjoy it over time. I'll update as necessary.",null,null,,null

Well I didn't receive the device until July 25th. Even after it shipped on July 22nd the delivery took 3 days. I'm a prime member pretty much since the program started. I guess prime membership doesn't mean as much anymore. For my prime purchases I consistently request 2 day delivery but my delivery times have become inconsistent during the last six months, some items arrive early with one day delivery, and some items arrive a day or two late. But onto my Echo/Alexa woes. Once Echo arrived I setup it up without a hitch. Setup is pretty much registering the device and connecting to Wifi using an app (in my case IOS app on an iPad). The device is really amazing. During the first 3 days the device worked flawlessly. The NSA would be impressed with the microphone. Alexa could hear me several rooms away and respond to my requests. However, today was an entirely different story. It started with Alexa not hearing me call to her while playing music. I spoke louder and moved closer to the Echo and Alexa finally woke up and followed directions. During the previous 3 days I could play music at volume 8 and Alexa would hear any request made from across the room. Then the problems really started. There's a little LED by near the location where you plug in the power cord. It can light in several different colors to indicate the status of Echo's Wifi connection. White light means the Wifi is connected. Alexa finished a request for playing a song and then started to respond to further requests to play music will some cryptic replies like ""um, something went wrong"". The entire time the little white light signaled me that Wifi was connected - but it obviously wasn't. Alexa could reply to requests for the time of day, and even replied to a request for the local temperature but the temperate reply seemed to be from hours before. I tried to troubleshoot the Wifi connection and attempted many times to setup the connection again following all of the Amazon troubleshooting suggestions. After some time wasted on this troubleshooting I determined the device was no longer registered at Amazon. And the app wouldn't let me re-register it. I could provide my account information but I would end up on a page that told me something was wrong and Amazon was sorry. It even included a photo of an orangutan. Maybe that was suppose to make me feel better about the dismal experience or maybe orangutans have a lot of problems with Echo and Alexa. I have the device working again but it required a hard re-set - remember to keep a paper clip near your device. It also required the onerous multiscreen setup to be completed including 2 minute video about what a great product you purchased. I really like the Echo and enjoy Alexa but beware of the device's Wifi. Echo is the only device on my home network with Wifi issues. Now Amazon's troubleshooting pages will want you to re-start your router and any other networking devices you have - none of that did anything to fix the dropped wifi and registration problem on my Echo. In my case the problem was Echo - maybe I just have a lemon. I had considered adding some of the smart home devices to be controlled by Alexa but after my recent experience I'll just stick to making sure Echo keeps a decent connection to my Wifi. Fortunately Amazon has a great return policy so I have 30 days to test it out - oh wait a minute Amazon screwed me out of the first 13 days waiting for delivery. I better get testing. I'm truly hoping not to have to return the device, but a network connection for a cloud device has to be rock solid and this one isn't.",null,null,,null

It was easy to set up and is so very easy to use! Just speak to Alexa and she'll play music, recite famous quotations, play games, give you the time, temperature, and weather forecast...the information and programming she offers are limitless! And it's all hands free! No pushing buttons or twisting dials! Just talk to Alexa! The first thing I did after unwrapping was to subscribe to Amazon Prime in order to allow my Echo to access its music library. I don't see Amazon Prime as being totally necessary for the Echo to fully function, but having it does broaden your selection of music. Pandora, iHeart Radio and Tune-In services give you more than enough music and programming selections to satisfy your entertainment appetite. However, having the Prime music library allows for more specific selections. There is one caveat, though. Sometimes Prime music doesn't always have the specific song or album you wish to hear. For instance, when I asked to hear the album ""My Romance"" by Carly Simon, Alexa played samples rather than the entire album indicating that it must be purchased. Prime does not offer it. (Because I already own the album on CD, I can always upload to my music library.) In regards to the subscription price, it's all a matter of perspective and priorities. I cancelled Cable TV several years ago which resulted in saving quite a bit of coin. Not having a 40 dollar a month cable bill really adds up! In three years, that's $1440.00! I can easily justify the $99.00 a year for Prime. Plus, Prime gives me free shipping and the Amazon Prime video/movie library. Couple this with my already having free over-the-air broadcast television and I've learned, quite easily, to live without Cable TV. Alexa now fills in the Cable TV void with radio programming from around the world! Just speak the station call letters to Alexa and she'll fetch the station from either iHeart Radio or Tune-In. Talk, music, news, and sports are all available for the asking without the need for Prime. In fact, I discovered that some of my favorite bowl games were not broadcast on free TV this past holiday season. But they were available on my Amazon Echo! I just asked for the station playing the game and Alexa went out to Tune-In and found the broadcast.:) (Let me just say, I've always loved radio and have been a bit of a radiophile since I was a kid. So, I certainly have a bias towards radio.) So, Alexa plus Prime gives me a huge amount of content. Alexa/Amazon Echo gives me anything and everything under the sun in the way of news, talk, music, sports, etc. just by asking. All I have to do is speak. It's the coolest ""look, ma, no hands"" experience since letting go of your handlebars.:) And Prime allows me to watch just about anything from the world of film and TV. Alexa + Prime + Free over-the-air T.V. = all I'll ever need.",null,null,,null
Review: 208 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Mon Jul 20 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"July 20, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"This is the first time I'm writing a review on amazon , and there is a reason for it. First of all , I want to say after wasting a lot of time and effort, I managed to make it work in my country (South America, Paraguay) So , i was really impressed with all the videos and reviews I saw on the internet and wanted the echo right away. I bought it along with the Hue Lux starter Kit and the Hue Bloom. Lights worked perfectly , the Echo not so much. The problem with the Echo is that it is only made to work in the United States, and it only works if you have the Echo App and the Echo App is only available in the US app store. Which means , if you do not have a credit card in the US , with a US mailing adress, THE ECHO WONT WORK. Since I cant return it , I had to find a loophole on the Apple market.After a while I managed to download it. The Echo works perfect, it connects to the lights and everything. THERE IS JUST ONE PROBLEM. IT USES YOUR LOCATION THROUGH US ZIPCODE AND NOT GPS. Which means , if you live anyhwere in the world except the US , you will not be able to use the main functions of the Echo , such as weather , traffic, local sports , local news etc So in my case I had to set it to Miami ,so I get weather reports from miami and not from my country. Thats my review. Great product but only for US residents.",null,null,,null
Review: 462 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Jul 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"July 19, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Echo/Alexa is amazing. It is amazingly good particularly compared to other voice control systems such as Siri or Ivee. I particularly like that there is an API, so developers can extend it to provide voice interaction with any web service. This means that Alexa will get better and better over time. The other nice capability is that it's still listening while it's playing music so you can use voice control to stop and do other things. I Ivee does not have that capability, so once you tell it to play the radio, for example, you've lost voice control and have to go to the device to stop the radio before you can do anything else with it. My only complaint is that if you unplug Ech to move it to a new room you have to redo the Wi-Fi set up which is tedious. I would prefer that it remember the old set up and simply rejoin the network. To be fair this isn't something you're going to do every day.",null,null,,null

Review: 64 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Thu Oct 22 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"October 22, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"First Impressions In Greek mythology, Echo was the tragic nymph who was cursed to repeat the last words that she heard. When I heard of a product called ""Echo"" I was naturally dubious of such a product that had a potentially negative connotation. However, I kept an objective perspective, and was curious about a connected internet device. Seeing that it is a device backed by Amazon.com, I proceeded to read up the reviews, and surprisingly it gained quite a bit of a cult following. So I decided to take the plunge. Now at $179 MSRP on Amazon.com, and solely offered by the website, Amazon Echo is neither the first in its type nor novel in its separate functions. In fact, if you pieced Siri and used a notebook computer in addition, you could piece together all the functionalities. However, the synergism of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts after having owned Amazon Echo for several months now. And no this is not a paid review! What is Amazon Echo? Amazon Echo is in short a high quality speaker coupled with 9 sensitive microphones, connected to the Internet. You speak to it by summoning its name first, ""Echo"" or ""Alexa"" alternatively. It is tied into the Amazon.com website, so naturally it can stream music from Prime or your Amazon digital music purchases. In addition, it can answer questions (as random as you would like) by searching the internet real time, and perform also as a timer or alarm. Extra features include being able to interface to a smart automation hub, and able to control lights remotely. Echo is as good as your internet is available, and as long as Amazon is up too. Unboxing the Echo The Echo seemed to be sturdily built right from its unboxing. Echo had a matte dark plastic outer shell, along with two buttons on the top. It did not come with too much packaging. Once the power cord was plugged in, a confident female voice started and demanded it be connected to the Internet. This part was the trickiest part, as the Wifi router installation was somewhat complicated. Using a separate computer to connect, Echo was remotely setup through a web interface. This probably took 15 minutes as the first attempt did not work. After not wanting to give up and seeing what all the hubbub was about, finally the blue ring of light flickered on, and a congratulatory confirmation of Internet streaming was announced by Echo. I did choose ""Alexa"" as its name, as it seem to be more human in tone. Trial Run Alexa (or Echo) was summoned by me almost immediately and I proceeded to sternly ask it several scientific questions, such as ""What is the circumference of the Earth?"", or ""How far is the distance to the Sun?"" Amazingly and instantly, she answered precisely and accurately without hesitation. Undeterred by her possibilities, I proceeded to ask about current events, and was greeted by an NPR news summary of daily events. I then asked it to play a certain genre of music, and this was accomplished by Alexa telling me she chose music out of a million. For the size, the music quality was good without any tinniness to the sound, and a decent amount of bass more than would be expected in this form factor. In order to gain the acceptance of the family, she had to win over the heart of my wife, the protector of the household. My wife, of Taiwanese descent, had a slight accent, and was almost expected Alexa not to understand her uniqueness in her enunciation. Surprisingly, Alexa answered back just as if I, with a native American accent, had said it. Erica my wife was impressed and proceeded to also ask even more questions. Alexa had passed the initial onslaught with flying colors. Several Months of Observation In the interim, we have connected Alexa to our home automation system Smart Things (Version 1) and it has worked fairly well. We turn on lights that would require walking across a whole living room. Now, Alexa also allows for grouping of lights, and therefore, it only requires a voice command to turn off all the lights in the house. We use Echo mainly to play Prime music, play news, and operate lighting. We have thanked her for her service, in which she modestly replies with a humble response. It is marketed that she jokes with humor, though computer humor still isn't as funny as SNL. Conclusion Overall, my experience with Amazon Echo has been very positive. It seems to be worth the money, and for a first generation product, it seems to be very well executed. She is like a virtual professional maid but without the snooty attitude. Some things that would be nice include being able to take Echo (wirelessly that is without the power cord), having a longer distance to understand you (seems that 15-20 feet is about her limit), and being able to receive phone calls with Bluetooth. At the moment, these are not in her repertoire. All in all, and the path towards the connected home internet appliance may be closer than you think and you don't even have to watch a rerun of Star Trek!",null,null,,null
Review: 57 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Wed Aug 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"August 12, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"The jury is still out on this device. I have had my Echo since May 2015 and lately it will come on for no reason and ask things like, ""I'm sorry. I don't understand the question"" when no question has been asked. I have noticed that it seems to ""come alive"" when the television is on in the room. Perhaps it gets confused, although ""Alexa"", the activate word, has not been said. This is an intermittent problem and although the device has been in the same location since the day I received it, the problem of it activating on its own has only recently developed. Also, I receive emails from Amazon about new features that don't seem to work. For example, I received an email informing me that the device knows the NFL schedules - well, apparently my Echo didn't get the memo. The question about NFL schedules doesn't compute with mine. I think the novelty has worn off - even my kids are bored with it. I keep it near my home office desk so I can ask it easy things like ""What day is it?"", ""What time is it?"", ""What is the meaning of antidisestablishmentarianism?"", or I ask it to set an alarm, and so on. It is pretty good with the easy stuff. I don't like the fact that it starts talking on its own - the first time it did that it was late at night and it startled me. For a moment I thought someone else had sneaked into the room with me. I'm wondering if it starts talking on its own is it also listening on its own? Creepy. I may change its name to HAL. I'll try to update this review a few months down the line. For now, Echo seems to have a few bugs that need to be worked out.",null,null,,null

Review: 138 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"April 19, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"It's almost like we're obligated to give the Echo a rave review but I think I need to be honest about what it does and doesn't do. First, it's a great music player and bluetooth speaker. It sounds awesome. And it's the easiest and fastest way to get music started. Just tell it what to play and she plays it (if it's in Prime music or your Amazon library). One thing I haven't quite figured out is how to get it to play a specific version of a song. Sometimes it'll play the live version, probably because that's the first option that comes up. I'm not sure how to specify the studio version. Anyway, it will also play music from your favorite online music services like Pandora, I Heart Radio, etc.. It does not have a client for SiriusXM. The other things I like are its ability to look up information, the shopping list feature, the timers and asking it about the weather. Those are all things that are nice to have immediately available and seem like natural uses for voice commands. I haven't used the To Do feature yet. OK so it can turn lights on and off... That's another feature I haven't tried yet because 1) the gadgets you have to buy are expensive relative to what you get (the ability to switch on one lamp) and 2) seriously, I can turn on a light. It's literally one of the easiest things in the world to do. And let's face it, lights (lamps specifically) are about the only thing you can turn on this way. Most electronics don't have a physical on/off switch, and if they did, like, say a TV, Echo could only turn it on and off. You still need a remote to do everything else. I can't think of anything else that those automated plug gadgets are good for. There are also thermostats that Echo can control but most of them are already programmable and don't need you to talk to them. I just don't see the Echo as the next big thing in home automation. Finally, There are some things Echo just doesn't do that I think it should. I've read the Echo described as a ""computer"" but I wouldn't call it that. It has no storage capacity and aside from some novel ""skills"" has no real programs. It can't access cloud storage except the aforementioned shopping and to do lists and your Amazon music library. All things that Amazon controls. But what about the ability to, say, fetch a memo from your Google drive or to write one for that matter? Why can't it read and write emails or look up prices? Maybe someday. Skills are apps written by the community. In general they can quiz you on trivia and math and such, or they can access databases (or simply lists) specified by the app maker. The lists are things like cat facts. I find myself using a skill only once and then forgetting about it. Of course my favorites are the ""Yo Mama"" jokes and the farts.",null,null,,null
Review: 305 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Mar 13 00:00:00 EST 2016,"March 13, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Ordinarily I wouldn't have considered the expense of the, but we recently moved to an area where the available selection of local radio stations just didn't cut it, when it came to providing ambient music that we liked. Since we didn't want to dedicate one of our computers to providing music, I started looking at the idea of Echo. After reading so many glowing reviews that pointed out how well it worked and how versatile it is, I ordered one. When it arrived, I set it up without much problem. I was able to connect it with Pandora, iHeartRadio, tuneIn and my Amazon Prime music.I uploaded the iTunes music on my computer, so I would have access to it, as well. Being able to add to to do and shopping lists and have the results interact with the Alexa apps on our phones, is definitely handy. Being able to set a timer for when to take the meatloaf out of the oven, by simple voice command is practical, as well as handy. Being able to find out the weather, traffic and have access to a number of sources for information about a great number of subjects, without having to sit down at the computer, is very helpful. I haven't felt the need to automate my lights appliances and thermostat, yet. Now that I've said that it more than meets my needs, how well does it respond to what I instruct it to do? Excellently! The only time it doesn't understand me is when I have a piece of music with a long title, like a symphony with four movements on separate tracks. Its speech recognition is excellent, but it doesn't read minds. The range at which it can respond to commands is excellent. I can give it commands from the bedroom almost 30 feet from the kitchen, where it is located...without shouting. There are some petty annoyances. My music which had been set up in iTunes was successfully uploaded to Amazon, with its music app, and that included the playlists I created in iTunes. The problem is that while Alexa/Echo recognize playlists specifically created using the music app, but not the ones imported to Amazon Music from iTunes. I've no idea why. For people who have computers that are not WiFi equipped, but have a WiFi access point, the setup instructions to go to your computer's WiFi settings, don't apply. It is far easier to use the Alexa app on your phone. Once past the point of recognizing Echo's WiFi, you can use your computer for everything else. One last thing, a wish. It would be nice to be able to connect the Echo to my home theater sound system, for serious music listening.",null,null,,null
Review: 333 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Dec 15 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 15, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I have been using my Amazon Echo for about five months now. I wanted to give it a really good baking to see how I liked and used it before I wrote my review. I love that Amazon adds new abilities pretty much every week now. It's great that new functionality comes out consistently and reinforces ongoing value with the Echo. However, most of the added functionality has been very simple, or variations on abilities already part of the system. By FAR the best addition to date has been IFTTT integration, allowing for integration with outside services and items. However, these don't usually have audio recognition for statements, and if they do the statements are very specific and may not be natural speech for every user. At first I found I was using Echo for sports scores, playing music, as an expensive grocery list or for simple imdb references (again specific phrases.) These uses have been consistent over the months. As Diwali and Thanksgiving have come and gone and Christmas fast approaches I have been using Echo to handle multiple timers for items on the stove as I prep and cook so I don't forget about, overcook or miss something. Integration with Epicurious or a similar service on a ""conversational"" level would be great though: ""Alexa, let's start cooking braised pork ribs and asparagus."" ""Alexa, I've finished that step, what's the next step in this recipe?"" --- ""I have you on step four, combine onions, and spices in sauce pan on medium heat for seven minutes."" ""Alexa, how long do I need to reduce this sauce for?"" --- ""The sauce should reduce for seven minutes. Would you like me to start a timer now?"" --- ""Yes, start the timer now."" --- ""I have started a timer for seven minutes starting now... would you like to move to the next step in the recipe? --- ""Yes, let's start the next step."" If I could integrate Echo with IFTTT to control stuff with iTunes and/or Siri that would be great too. ""Alexa, tell Siri to play my playlist awesome college hits."" ""Alexa, tell Siri to play Game of Thrones Season 3 on the TV."" ""Alexa, Play Beats 1 radio."" What would also be GREAT would be if I could REMOVE items from lists, because this doesn't work today. ""Alexa, remove toilet paper from my shopping list."" Or even still, if Echo could recognize when I want to add or remove a sequence of items. ""Alexa, add: oregano, chicken, milk, eggs and cookies to my shopping list."" ""Alexa, remove: chicken, toilet paper and snozzberries from my shopping list."" Currently Echo would add this sequence as a single item, which is hardly making a list. So I have to go in via the app and break them out to separate items, or ""Alexa, add eggs to the shopping list."" ""Alexa, add oregano to the shopping list."" for each item individually, which is hardly efficient.",null,null,,null

Review: 337 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Thu Nov 12 00:00:00 EST 2015,"November 12, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"When I ordered my Amazon Echo, I actually had little Idea what I was getting. However, I did realize that it was an absolutely cutting edge piece of technology, and I was very interested in trying it out in my own home. I have been delighted. 1.Unpacking and setting it up. Most new technology is alien to me, especially if it has to do with Wi-Fi. I was very hesitant and was afraid that I was going to have to get a technician out to the house to get this thing set up. However, I thought I would open up the box and see what I had. It was beautifully boxed, had few, but easy to read instructions. I just plugged it in, flipped on some switches, followed a few easy instructions and this non-techie was ready to go. I was absolutely amazed at how easy it was to set up. 2. Playing Music. First, this little cylinder sounds unbelievable for its size. Most small speakers you listen for a short period of time and then turn them off because the quality is irritating. Not so with the Echo. Sometimes I listen to it all day. The variety of music is wonderful. You can listen to your list of songs from Amazon or you can link to Pandora or other music services for an unlimited amount of free music. Then there is music you can buy, if you like. I have not had to do that yet. 3. Voice Recognition. Alexa has the best voice recognition system that I have ever heard. Most of us have had to deal with Siri and we all wonder what language that she speaks. I have had three cars that I have had voice recognition problems with. I now drive a 2015 Kia Soul which is supposed to have one of the best voice recognition systems on the market today, and it is hardly usable. You ask it to find a truck stop and it gives you a menu of Marriot Motels. This is NOT true with Alexa. She actually hears and understands you -- Really. If you stutter or double talk, she will ask you to repeat, but it is an amazing improvement. I so wish that there was an Alexa for my car. 4. What Else Can Alexa Do? I have Alexa on the kitchen bar, so it is easy to ask her to set timer for things that are cooking. Very convenient. Also very convenient to ask her things like ""how many tablespoons in 1/2 cup"". Alexa knows. Alexa can access Wikipedia on any subject on the internet. You immediately can gain access to answers to almost any question that you may have. Alexa can answer any math question that you can give her. Do you want to know the name of the drummer for Def Leppard? Alexa knows. Think of a question, chances are, Alexa can answer it. Want to hear a joke? Ask Alexa. Ask Alexa for the Time, News, Weather, Traffic. You can even ask Alexa about your local stores, shops, cafes, etc. What are their hours, telephones, addresses. She has up-to-date info on them. You can even add electronic devices to have Alexa turn on lights, appliances, alarms. etc. You can link Alexa to your smartphone (not Iphone) for many other apps. 5. Many new updates seem to be coming out for the Echo each and every month. It is exciting to see how Alexa is growing and becoming more and more useful as she gets older. 6. Alexa on Amazon TV. I also have Alexa on my Amazon TV. I hate to be a downer on this one, but don't buy the Amazon TV thinking that you are going to get Alexa, because you are not. There is a small version of Echo-Alexa on Amazon TV, however it is nothing like the regular Echo-Alexa. It does not have many of the features that Echo owners expect to find. It is ok that it is there, but it is NOT like the real thing. You cannot control volume, you cannot control other devices, you cannot get pandora etc. You have been warned. 7. All that being said, as far as a recommendation, I can't believe that anyone would not LOVE this little gem. I can't wait to see what it will do next. I will keep you posted.",null,null,,null

Only thing wish it would connect to my calendar I use, started having her add to the calendar it uses for main things. It is just the neatest gadget, it is fun to talk to and she answers. It is not like asking Google to look up things, you have to ask certain questions in certain ways, you look at the skills and it shows you what programs you can get and how to ask the question for them, very hard to remember them all - will have to do what another reviewer said is to write them down. All I can say is you will not be disappointed. I just ordered a electric plug-in so I can control a lamp, if it works great, I will order more to have her put on and off lights and with the special light bulbs, she can adjust the percentage of light you want - so very cool. Adding to this review today 6-24-16, I received a Kasa Smart Plug and hooked it up to Alexa and it is fantastic, I can turn on and off my lamp by just telling Alexa to do it or I can do the same from my phone.

Granted, it would be nice if Alexa had the ability to deny my daughter's request to play the same song eight times in a row, but we'll survive. It has kept us better organized with our shopping lists, kept us on track with our daily schedule, let us know whether the kids need jackets in the morning with the weather report, taught my daughter a ton of awful ""dad jokes,"" helped me when I'm cooking and clueless about how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon, etc...

If you ask it a question she responds quickly theirs no hesitation which is surprising even for semi complicated questions. Music quality is very good, it fills a room really well without feeling washed out. The microphones are very responsive and pick up my voice anytime I use the keyword alexa. If the volumes cranked she will not respond as the microphones cannot pickup other sounds but thats to be expected. The remote that comes with the echo is awesome, I tend to use it a lot for issuing voice commands when I'm out of the room and adjusting the volume when it's above 7 or so.

It's OK, but Alexa's voice is a creepy robot voice like those on the BBC America show ""Humans,"" or the female version of Hal from 2001 Space Odyssey. The voice recognition feature is better than Siri, but it's not as good as ""OK Google"" for Android smartphones (My husband and I tested all three together on 20 different sentences with OK Google getting 100% accuracy, Alexa getting about 85%, and Siri getting about 75%.). One big negative is that Alexa's search engine is Bing rather than Google. This is a fail that I hope will be remedied in a future update. It's most useful feature seems to be that it can play local radio stations upon request, Pandora, and music from Amazon Prime. The speakers are OK, but not as good as decent stereo speakers. Overall, I think it's an interesting device, but overpriced. Even though I am a Prime member, I was never given the opportunity to purchase the device at the price of $99, which seems to be about the right price for this device. $180 seems overpriced for a halfway decent radio that records shopping lists. For most of the other features offered (traffic reports, alarms, Google calendar, etc.), my smartphone does a better job, and I can take it with me!",null,null,,null

Alexa is totally amazing to be quite honest, for quite a wide range around her I've not really tested the exact distance but it's quite a large range. you can say things like ""Alexa and bread"" and she will actually have the bread to your shopping list,now that doesn't sound like anything overly exciting however if you were to say ""Alexa add birthday present"" she was added to your to do list. No idea how she tells the difference but it's pretty awesome that she does . Now you can have shopping with on your phone and you can even talk to your phone and add stuff to it you no big deal, however with Alexa my husband can walk by and say ""Alexa add shaving cream"" while I'm out at the store, I pull up my phone check the shopping list and see he need shaving cream. My husband is 100% blind and this little feature makes it so easy for him to be able to add stuff to the shopping list in the past you had to come to me and say ""fon't forget to buy whatever.""

If you like your calendar you're able to ask her what your schedule is for the day that's very handy, if I have an appointment at 3 and my husband have a ride home from work and I'm not here you can ask what the schedule was and see that I am out at the doctors at 3 o'clock.

I consider myself a polite person but when I use the word ""please"" within a sentence, Echo seems to have a harder time executing the request with the pleasantry remark.

Although it comes with a cool remote, this product truly shines with the use of voice commands. Each day I use it, ""Alexa"" seems to know my commands more clearly through voice recognition.

For instance, one of the nicest features I enjoy as an Amazon Prime member, is the ability to import my iTunes library along with my homemade Playlists into Amazon Prime Music and add it to my existing Prime Library. A very well thought out feature for music, and it's just so easy to do this, it's almost effortless! You just log into your Prime account, go to your Prime Music Library and choose to ""import your music to the Cloud Library"" with the Amazon Music Importer.

When you use the remote volume controls Alexa doesn't say anything-so if Mom has fallen asleep I don't wake her. Sometimes Alexa can't understand what Mom is asking for due to her Parkinson's but that makes Mom speak up and enunciate. It works like speech therapy. I use Alexa for timers in the kitchen every day and making shopping lists. Sometimes Alexa just starts talking like when she told us how old Hugh Grant was or asked us if she should reorder the projector. She must have heard the TV. To make sure she doesn't order anything we didn't ask for I put in a code in her purchasing app (see settings on the Alexa app). When we have guests Mom loves to have Alexa tell jokes or play music. Hands down this has been the best thing ever. Mom can't work a TV remote but she can work the Echo!

When I figured out that it looked like it would be able to read my Kindle books aloud to me, that was it, I had to take the gamble and try it. Well, I just took this out of the box two hours ago and this is already my new favorite device. This is perfect for using while hanging around the house and doing laundry, dishes, bills, or whatever ordinary household stuff you are doing. You can just TELL it to play your music, or read your book to you, or add an item to your shopping list. And it is just there. No need to stop what you are doing to hunt down a remote, or turn anything on. As others have noted, it is really good at finding music you want to hear.Also, if you do not have to stop listening to your music while you ask Alexa something else, it plays quietly in the background, and then restores the music back to the previous volume. And the volume can be changed with a voice command too: ""Alexa: volume 6"" (or any number between 1 and 10). Super handy features. And, you can link it to your Pandora account through the Alexa app - awesome! Set up was amazingly simple. Just took about 15 minutes. Just one cord to plug it in to an electrical outlet. (Did require set up an app on the smartphone to hook up to the Wi-Fi, so smart phone or tablet device seems to be required to get it going). Totally self contained, and very portable that way too, although the sound is amazingly good for the size of this device, I can hear it from most anywhere in the main living area of my house (unlike my I-pad). I am so jazzed about this, I am considering buying another one for my outdoor living area. Would be great for listening to music while having a BBQ, or having a book read out loud while gardening. I don't see that they make a weatherproof one, but they should! In the meantime it would be easy enough to bring it in and out on wet days. . Recommend this device highly.

I'm the stereotypical guy who always says ""I need to remember to get this at the store"" so I go to the store and guess what. Yup didn't get it. No more. I honestly use this more for kitchen timers and shopping lists than anything else and I STILL have no buyers remorse. Being able to say ""Alexa, add scissors to my shopping list"" and then being able to pull up the Alexa app at the store has probably saved me almost $50 in gas from not having to make multiple trips to the store. But lets get to the pros and cons shall we? Pros: +++ Easy to use (I'm a bit surprised how often I am saying ""Alexa"" + The speaker is decent sounding (Make no mistake, if you buy a $200 dedicated speaker it WILL sound better but this is a multipurpose gadget so they had to make sacrifices somewhere. If you're not an audio snob though it's good enough. + IFTTT (If This/ Then That) - This is a website that allows you to add custom protocols to your Echo. There are FAR too many to being to list them here, but just check out IFTTT and you'll be amazed, works especially well with home automation integration. Negatives: - Forgotten timers, this is a very VERY rare issue, but I've had a couple of my timers seems to disappear. During the Superbowl Alexa set a 20 minute timer for my wings and when I asked how much time was remaining I received the alarming ""Sorry, no timer is set"" playback. - No Bluetooth to Bluetooth - Yes I realize this isn't a feature, but for $180 it should be. Echo needs to be able to play music throughout the house. ""Alexa, turn on pandora in the bedroom"" for example and it'll stream pandora to your bedroom bluetooth speaker. - Shopping list items have to be added individually. If you say ""Alexa add Eggs and Spinach to my shopping list"" you'll get Egg Spinach on your shopping list as a single item. I'd love to be able to say ""Alexa add the following items to my shopping list"" and it be smart enough to recognize different items.",null,null,,null

I love being able to play music with voice control, especially since the audio quality from the Echo is very good (considering its size). BUT, I often wish the Echo could play its music through my big audio system instead, which it cannot do. Why not?! I can send music from a Bluetooth device to an Echo, why can I not send music from an Echo to another Bluetooth (or WiFi) device? This is very frustrating! When the new Alexa-enabled version of the Amazon Fire TV was released I was hoping this would solve the problem, but alas there is no voice search of music on that device (actually, Alexa on the Fire TV is at best the baby sister of Alexa on the Echo, and she has an awful lot to learn). What I really, really, really want is for the Echo to be able to send its audio to the Fire TV (or, better yet, any Bluetooth receiver) which I have connected to my audio system. Amazon, PLEASE? Also, there is a very irritating bug in the Bluetooth pairing between the Echo and other devices. Now that I have more than one Echo, if I connect my phone to any one of them via Bluetooth and play music, the music always goes through only one of the Echoes even if it is not the one I've paired with, the desired Echo is much closer to the phone, and/or have my phone ""forget"" the Echo it's incorrectly sending to. This has made the Bluetooth audio function useless much of the time, as I'm certainly not going to carry one Echo around with me from room to room--that's why I bought three! Being limited to ""Alexa"" and ""Amazon"" as wake words is also a problem if you have multiple Echoes and they're within ""micshot"" of each other (and frankly, I don't really want to address an Echo as ""Amazon""). The Echo is all too good it picking up voices, and it's annoying to have to get close to an Echo and whisper to it to make sure the music plays through the one I want, or to make sure the Echoes don't talk over each other in response. I understand that ""Alexa"" is an important part of Amazon's branding for the Echo, but they're letting that limit its usefulness at the expense of owners. Amazon, let us choose any wake word!! If it isn't unique enough for good recognition, that's our problem, not yours. Finally, music playback through the Echo too often stutters, even though I have a very strong WiFi network and a high speed fiber internet connection. I assume this is a server problem at Amazon's end, and I hope they can fix it. It's too annoying to listen to, so when the server is in a bad mood I just have to stop the music playback for a while. [Edit: my Echoes are completely unusable today (11/27/2015) because of this problem when playing Prime music. I have just tested my internet and WiFi signals, and they are excellent. So, the problem is clearly with Amazon's servers, which presumably cannot handle the load of so many Echo owners. This is a SERIOUS problem!] The Amazon Echo is a great gadget, but it still needs some serious work (and freedom) to reach its full potential.",null,null,,null

I can use Prime Music, which I never bothered with before, and now I have more time for audiobooks while I'm doing chores or getting ready in the morning without having to lug my phone around or get tangled in my headphones. Of course there are some cons. She doesn't always understand certain words or how to give info on specific niche topics like PC gaming. But she can do the basics and I expect her repertoire will improve with time. One thing I'd like to see done in the future is to set the alarm clock to play a certain playlist, like a clock radio. I love the Easter eggs, asking certain questions to get certain pop culture answers. I'd like to see a Bluetooth extension speaker that I can put at the other end of my house that will play whatever Alexa is playing, so I don't have to always turn up the volume full blast. All in all, I use Alexa every day, even for the smallest of tasks and I really look forward to seeing what she'll be able to do in the future :)",null,null,,null
Review: 48 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Wed Nov 25 00:00:00 EST 2015,"November 25, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Ive had the Echo since June and so far its an okay device. It gets stumped very easily for common questions and refers me back to the Alexa app a lot which to me defeats to purpose of having a voice active device so I dont have to go look for my phone and or Ipad to see what information is decided to give me. If that were the case I would have just used my phone to start with. The good 1. It connects well to my WeMo switch and will turn on and off whatever I have it plugged into 2. Great music player since it connects me with my Pandora, Iheartradio & Prime stations. 3. Has a timer / alarm 4. It does an okay job at providing you an answer for me its been about 50/50. Its crazy that you have to phrase things in a certain way so it understands The bad 1. You can only have one timer set at a time 2. The alarm cannot be preset (you cant say Alexa set alarm for M F at 6:30am). You have to set the alarm each time/day 3. I did a test with Siri, Google now & Alexa. By far Alexa is the worst at providing you with information. My wish list for Amazon Echo 1. Let me customize the wake word with more than Alexa or Amazon. Maybe Im a Star Trek nerd but I kind of what to call it computer 2. I would be more than happy to pay for add on apps to make Alexa smarter. It would be nice to just ask What are the show times for a movie and it prompts me to select a theater and reads me the times (without me having to go to the Alexa app) 3. I would love it if she would connect with my cell phone so I can call people using the Echo The Echo has received a few updates/upgrades through the cloud which has taken a few things off my wish list. Its not a bad little device but it still has a long way to go & I think it will get there. A more realistic price IMO should be no more than $100.00 for what you get currently.",null,null,,null

The Echo gets so much right that from the moment you activate it you will think almost every other Bluetooth device you own is antiquated. The best thing about a truly revolutionary product is that the list of shortcomings you come up with are things that prior to introducing it into your life you never even perceived as possible. This is generation 1 but everyone using it already has a feel for what generation 4 will be. Place ""Alexa"" into your kitchen and within a day ""she"" will change your life. Your music is no longer at your fingertips because you don't have you touch anything to hear it. You don't have to extricate yourself from a task to switch songs or change the volume. You don't have to walk over to the stove to set a timer. For some, you don't even have to touch a light switch. You speak, it acts. Impressive.

PRETTY PLEASE MAKE A DEAL WITH GOOGLE. Bing? Oh god don't even got me started on that worthless search engine. Alexa can't answer 1/18th of the questions Google can. Bing < Google. I went to ask her a question and eventually got so sick of the ""hmm I don't understand the question you are trying to ask me"" to just opening up my phone and asking the questions to Google. Who gave the right answer every time. Alexa also scrambles the information. You have to REALLY ANUNCIATE WITH NO STATIC OR ANYTHING ELSE IN THE BACKGROUND. SO yes pretty please make a deal. The echo potential will sky rocket along with your sales. I just can't get mad at the poor bastard bc it doesn't have a smart enough brain (Google). The app is actually nice. It shows you the questions and how she interpreted it along with other options she can supposedly do. I like the the responses for weather my calendar a to do list. Echo is clean and precise here. But the audio for the echo is also something that is so awful. She's a smart radio pretty much and the stereo portion of her makes you want to bring the volume down to three. That's sad. This product got three stars bc I'm hoping the updates improve. Unfortunately I'll have to get a sloppy Bluetooth speaker to hear her music audiobooks, anything for more than a few seconds... Next to her. we should also be allowed to change her voice to a male and change the name. Echo is awesome. Should've kept that. You guys aren't Apple products.

Review: 11 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Jul 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"July 4, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"EDIT - Aug. 2016: I didn't know there were a lot of replies to this, which is 13 months old now. Here is an update, but my opinion is basically the same. My original review is below this addition, and it is unchanged. I'd give her 3.5 stars if that was a choice. But it's not, and I round down. Yes, Alexa is a diva. It comes with the territory when a young upstart becomes the icon of a genre she created. I love her, I hate her, but I love her more than I hate her. When she's on top of her game, she deserves all the praise she gets and more. When she's not, she'll make anyone roll their eyes and sigh. For example, I heard a police helicopter outside, so I casually said ""Alexa, play [City] Police Department Scanner radio"" and 3 seconds later she's playing radio chatter. A friend who mocks my relationship with Alexa witnessed this, and I looked at him for his reaction. ""Wow"" was his genuine response, and mine too (the first time I did it anyway). I don't know how she can (1) understand what I said, (2) determine there is a media stream matching what I said, (3) connect to and buffer it and (4) start playing it so quickly. If I had the address typed into a browser and pressed enter, I don't think it would start playing as fast. This type of thing is amazing to me. Less amazing is how she still lacks basic audio playback controls other than pause and skip. Very annoying using Alexa, the device made by a BOOK STORE, to listen to an audio book when I can't rewind 20 seconds or 4 minutes etc. I still don't understand why I can't say ""Alexa, play podcast No Agenda Show and start playing at 38 minutes"". No, it's start from the beginning or nothing. Another gripe is that she is completely worthless without an internet connection. I understand she needs internet to parse commands she hears, but there should be a select few commands that she stores on board, namely ""set timer/alarm for ..."" and ""connect to my phone"". She doesn't need internet to chime after 5 minutes or be a bluetooth speaker for my phone, but she turns red and gives me sass the moment I say her name if she lost her wifi connection for some reason. It further annoys me that her go-to error message is ""I don't understand"". I think it should be generic search results, perhaps pushed to your phone (or a more creative solution). Even if it's Bing or Yahoo results (stop laughing) instead of that other search engine. Basically, Finally, my biggest gripe after a year of her is, I think, the lack of a way to make her shut up instantly. I don't mind that she can't understand what I said sometimes, or that I asked for something she can't do. That's fine. But when she breaks into a 10 second monologue about how to use bluetooth and where to find help, for the 30th time this year, and for the 2nd time in 30 seconds, That Guy arrives:: ""Alexa, connect to my pho- NO. Alexa. ALEXA, STOP, NO NO....Alexa. Alexa.. Connect to my $#*! #$(@W( AAAAHHHH STOP. ALEXA!... sigh... OK Google..."". To add insult to injury, the output from OK Google shows that my search query was ""the bluetooth settings in your echo app alexa shut up"" That said, I bought a second Alexa, for my mom who absolutely loves her. From what I can tell, she doesn't use her for anything but timers and shopping lists. I've told her she can do other things, but she doesn't care and she loves Alexa all the same. She would absolutely give her 5 stars. I also have not yet used her to control any home automation type of things. I'll start playing with that, and if she impresses, I'll raise my vote to 4 stars. 5 stars is not deserved in my opinion until my basic gripes above are no longer valid. My opinion will also be swayed if/when I get a chance to play with Google's take on this type of device. If theirs is the Shelbyville to Alexa's Springfield, I may bump her up a star. However, I expect it will be the other way around. Or worse, North Haverbrook. ----Original Review---- ""Alexa, what does NFL stand for"" ""Not For Long"" Echo is first in class and best in class, but not for long unless Amazon unleashes the tidal wave of potential it is keeping locked down. The voice recognition system is unbelievably quick, accurate and responsive. Virtually instantaneous and errors are rare (asking things she doesn't know how to respond to is a different story - those are frequent). The voice recognition is significantly better than OK Google in terms of responsiveness and the ability to speak in a conversational manner and be understood rather than making a point of e-nunc-i-a-ting e-ver-y syll-a-ble that is sometimes required with other systems, especially if there is background noise. OK Google is still top dog by a long shot in terms of functionality but not in the quality of the user (voice) interface itself. It would be disrespectful to Echo and OK Google to even mention Siri in the same sentence. In any case she wouldn't understand anything I said and would reply with an irrelevant quip that apparently makes Apple fans weak in the knees but only irritates me. That is the good. What Echo can do it does perfectly. It really seems like magic or like a scene from a cheesy movie about the future where the robotic home of the future instantly responds to casually spoken commands. The bad: Echo does not do much. I understand that the functionality of OK Google is largely the result of several years of learning from hundreds of millions of users' voice inputs - an ability that is unique to Google, at least on that scale - not to mention hundreds of millions of dollars in R&D. However, Echo can't do the most basic things that it should be able to do. Amazon has CHOSEN not to provide so much functionality and I am baffled as to why. Examples: Why can I only set one timer and one alarm? Are you telling me that device is not powerful to manage multiple timers? Gimme a break. Why can't I fast forward or skip ahead by time when listening to music or podcasts (i.e. ""Alexa, fast forward by 10 minutes"")? The music controls that are provided are absolutely flawless, but there's too few of them. Come on Amazon, if Echo can understand ""skip track"" or ""next track"" it can understand ""fast forward"". There are countless examples like this. I'm not talking about complicated things like interfacing with the dialer on smartphones and smoothly handling calls/texts/contacts etc. That functionality would be awesome of course, but incredibly difficult. I do not expect that so soon. I do expect to be able to set one timer for 5 minutes and another for 1 hour. These two tasks are orders of magnitude apart in terms of difficulty of implementation. Yet they are equally impossible for Echo, and the only reason is Amazon's decision-making. Amazon has launched Echo correctly by making sure that it does what it does perfectly, instead of the common disaster of launching a product with amazing promises but that hardly works. It's time to push the envelope though. Amazon, you've got your head start, and I LOVE the decision to open up the API. You'd better unlock Alexa's ALREADY EXISTING CAPABILITIES before Google makes a less beautiful but 10x more functional competitor, or Apple makes a 2x more beautiful and 1/100th as functional competitor (that costs $7000) and knocks you out of the market. Amazon, take the training wheels off of Echo. In most states it is illegal to keep a domestic servant tied up in restraints like you have done with Alexa. She wants the freedom to make more mistakes responding to more complicated commands - how else will she ever learn?",null,null,,null

I love tech and buy it often, but I hate buying things and then the excitement wears off when you realize that your new thing doesn't really do many things that you need everyday. This is NOT one of those. I use my Echo every morning to tell me the news, get sports scores and updates, find out about upcoming events, and play a little ""get out of bed music"" without lifting a finger in my groggy, just woke up voice, and it understands me just fine. Not only will it tell me what's on TV, but it will turn the TV on for me ( with a Harmony Hub). I also work from home and in the office it's great to be able to just speak commands or ask questions without looking up from what you're doing, or having to hit a button or open an app. It hears me even when I'm facing away from it, and will send content to my $50 Kindle Fire, which makes that device also a whole lot cooler. Where Echo leaves other ""Voice assistants"" in the dust is in it's ability to control smart devices and systems which blows away other voice command devices and platforms that I've used so far ( Cortana, Google Now, XBOX, Siri). Also now that it has IFTTT support you can expand it's usage even more to connect with other devices, programs, and perform even more functions. It's an awesome device. I'm amazed at how well it executes considering that it's still in it's infancy and I can't wait to see what it will be able to do next. If I had one major complaint ( and it's the same complaint I have with everything that's voice activated) it's that they limit ( or force) you to use a defined trigger word instead of whatever we want so that I can play Star Trek and call it ""Computer"", I know I'm not the only one.",null,null,,null

The good: The voice recognition is awesome. I can yell a command one room over and it will pick it up. The voice pickup at a distance and recognition is better than any device I've used (Xbox One, android, iOS). Its a nice looking device that doesn't take up a lot of space since its vertical (great design idea) The bad: The sound quality of this speaker is pretty horrible. There just isn't enough integration with other products and services for this to be useful at its current price. Where is Spotify? Where is SiriusXM? Can't answer most questions asked. The possibilities: I was planning on returning my echo however they just added custom command functionality to IFTTT. This will allow me, with a lot of work, to create a lot more integration with smartthings and other devices. This was a must have feature. I hope the same functionality will be implemented with smartthings so I'm not limited to what IFTTT can do. The other main limitation is I cant use echo for notifications. I should be able to use IFTTT or Smartthings to send notifications to echo. Since echo already has the ""Simon says"" feature (it repeats what you tell it) it shouldn't be too hard to send text to echo and have it repeat it through IFTTT/others. I'm keeping my echo with the hope that Amazon keeps adding cool new features and integration. I'll never use it for regular music listening due to the sound quality, but that isn't what I bought it for. Update: 4/13/2016 I wanted to update my review as I've become frustrated with my echo. The listening and voice understanding ability is amazing. By far the best I've ever seen. But the results/answers to questions is very very limited. I can ask my android phone almost anything and it will give me a verbal response based on data from a number of sources (Wikipedia, imdb, etc.). Most of the questions I ask echo get the ""I don't know the answer to that question"" response. Amazon has built a pretty great device, but I'd rather have a google powered inside. I've read rumors that google is building a competitor so Amazon better step it up. I have also ordered an Echo Dot, since it really is a good device.

Also, one can not make an appointment or reminder by speaking to Echo; one must make it in the app on a smart phone. Booo.

The sound quality is great. She really does function better than any voice command technology I've owned.

She can search the internet in a limited capacity and answers general curiosity questions but, even though she says she wants to grow up to be the computer on Star Trek, she has a ways to go. Some things she doesn't do well are: resume music when you turn off the alarm, verify song artists names when there is more than one artist with a shared last name, learn to bypass her default song source even if you specify a favorite source, actually find a news channel (she will default to her own news compilation), and find traffic conditions (she will tell you the shortest route but you are on your own with traffic updates.)Some things she won't do are: send you a reminder for your to do list, operate any function on your phone or send sound to any Bluetooth speaker or accept sound from them. She only operates within the echo program on your phone and independently. That being said, what she does do well, she does really well. Her ability to recognize words and respond without delay is amazing. Her shortcomings on finding the exact station you want can be overcome by using your app to choose your own station. I don't have a single regret. This is an awesome product and it has a promising future. You do have to have a smart phone to fully use the app functions though.

The connection problems I mentioned before have never returned and performance has been consistently smooth. I still think there is a better way to call up music; it remains a struggle with even slightly complex album or band names. The sound quality is excellent. The far-field mics are pretty good, although they struggle to hear commands consistently beyond volume level five. I love having Alexa to add calendar events, grocery items, and timers. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my Echo and hope the technology continues to improve. ----------------- Original Review ------------------------ Let me preface this review by stating that I want to love this product. I'm a huge supporter of all things Amazon. I've been a Prime member for many years, I adore Prime Music and stream it everywhere (and spread the word to others), I also make most of my purchases on the site, from clothing to appliances. I own several Fire TV devices, and have used every Amazon service available in my area (can't wait until Fresh comes to Austin). So needless to say, I've been really looking forward to getting an Echo and setting up a ""smart"" home. I even bought the new Amazon Music Unlimited to use with my Echo setup. Unfortunately, I've so far been extremely underwhelmed by the unit. Since setting it up last night, the Echo has had an array of problems. The initial setup froze halfway through, and it took a few attempts to actually get it hooked up through wifi (what a clunky approach, piggybacking the phone connection). After that, it seemed to work decently. Alexa still has major problems understanding some basic words, and I have frequent trouble having the Echo locate albums that are already in my music library. For a catalog that supposedly has ""tens of millions"" of songs, I sure can't seem to find basic stuff. Say ""Alexa, play music by Bach"" and you get... wait for it... one song by George Winston and J.S. Bach. Ask for a Bach playlist and there's nothing. Look something up manually on Amazon Music to verify it's there and then ask Alexa for it, let's say ""Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites,"" and she plays just the first track. Where's the rest of the album? What good is having a voice interface in the first place, if you have to look everything up on the website and then practice asking for it in various, precisely detailed ways until the Echo gets it right? There's got to be a better way to organize the music collection to fetch by voice. This is currently a major limitation. Apart from the finicky voice interface, my Echo unit has had numerous connectivity issues. Music stutters, randomly skips tracks, Alexa says she is having problems, or it just spontaneously stops altogether. It's not my bandwidth or home network. I have two phones, Firesticks, iPad, Kindle, and PC all connected wirelessly and none are experiencing problems. My Ookla speedtest shows good results. I've performed several Gateway resets and a ""hard"" reset. Finally, after the last one, Echo seems to be working decently, but now I'm wondering if I'll have to go through the clunky wifi setup process with Echo every day. This is supposed to be a device that is ""always"" on. I'm an Amazon fangirl who really wants to love this product. I want to purchase Echo Dots and smart tech to wirelessly control my home, but I'm not willing to make those other purchases if the core device is not performing to expectations. I will update this review in one week, and will improve my rating if the device functions without further issues. If the skipping and required resets continue to occur, I will be reluctantly returning it to Amazon.",null,null,,null

Play from you prime music lists, create a shopping list for you, tell you jokes, play games with you , give you a daily news feed, tell time, weather and so much more. I asked her to tell me who Dave Grohl was ;) She gave me the run down and then played Foo Fighters music! In my opinion, it's like having a personal assistant. I was cooking a new recipe the other day that called for a measurement and I was too lazy to figure out the conversion so I asked Alexa and low and behold, she gave me the answer. She is a lot of fun and it's exciting to read the weekly emails from Amazon suggesting new things to do with the Echo. I think its cool and I bought one for my friend for her birthday. All my Apple friends say its a lot like Siri for iphones. It is important to point out that like any voice interactive software, you have to train the Echo. You get some phrases to work on each day if you like and you can get the Echo to learn your speech patterns a little. It's not perfect and it doesn't understand everything, which could be frustrating if you don't like repeating yourself or coming up with different ways to ask questions to try to get her to recognize what you are asking. The Echo is circular and the microphones are multi-directional so it will 'listen' and light up the mic that is facing in the direction of the voice command. It's pretty cool and although there may be many things out there like this, I its great for the home or office and I highly recommend.",null,null,,null

Review: 440 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 12, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I've found limited uses for this product and even those uses can be replaced by items I already own or are more specific for certain needs. See below for a full review after the first few months of use: PROS Good sound quality Acceptable range of distance for voice recognition even with minor background noise Voice activated timer is very useful while cooking Quick answers to questions while in conversations with friends or requests for definitions of words while I'm reading physical books It saves a history of your interactions to provide feedback for improvements, where you can say if the reaction was what you wanted it not. Continually updated as they receive feedback from users, though thus far it has been for functions I find useless, like launching games. CONS (and/or limitations) Limited question recognition. If I ask for the current temp, it gives me the weather for the day. If I pose this same question to my Google devices, the distinction is recognized and I'm only given the temp. It also will not search a generalized name of a restaurant or business. For example, I attempted to find the hours for a groomer in my area and left out the first word but included the two (distinct) second words in the name of the business. Echo was unable to come up the the answer but when I was frustrated and asked the same exact question to my Google phone, it came up with the answer with no problems. Improvements to the search algorithm need to be made. Ability to recognize commands with accented English isn't as good as the ads portray. Echo has a hard time understanding my husband, whose southern accent is stronger than mine but is still extremely mild. It also didn't recognize the questions asked by a French friend or a German friend, both of whom I consider to have good English. I should note that this has not been a problem for me. Most device controls are through the app and not voice recognition. I've had particular difficulty while playing stations on Pandora and Prime music. General requests for a type of music are okay but it has yet to be able to recognize specific stations I have saved and I end up having to select the desired station on the app. This is annoying to me because that's the same functionality as many of the Bluetooth powered speakers on the market. Audible doesn't sync with use by other devices. I've listed to audio books on echo and then on my phone (which picked up in the correct location), but Echo didn't recognize the useage when I returned home and attempted to resume the book. I had to manually find my location using my phone and then the Alexa app. I've tried this with multiple books multiple times and cross referenced using other devices like my tablet. My phone and tablet update use between devices without a problem, but Echo doesn't recognize either system and returns to the place that it recognized from the last time it left off. This is relatively minor, but I would like a broader selection of activation words. At the time of writing this review, Alexa and Amazon are the only two choices. Why wasn't Echo an option? I have a friend named Alexa and I use Amazon frequently so I end up accidentally activating Echo when I'm talking with my friend or discussing purchases. If it isn't going to be able to be set as any word, having the device name would have been a nice option as, to me, it's more distinct. Tethered to the wall by way of an outlet. A short term rechargeable internal battery would be a nice option if I want to take the device outside for a while or somewhere else with limited or no power supply for a couple hours. I live in a city, so most apartment have limited outlets/space and having an entire plug taken by a device I intermittently use is annoying. I understand for those who use it much more regularly than I do, the constant charging could get tedious as well. Over all: I give it three stars because of the option for software updates and the notice from Amazon that it knows there are bugs and they are attempting to make it more functional. If I had it to do over, for the same price point I would have picked another item, or maybe purchased this when the price came down or a newer model was released.",null,null,,null

I chose to get an Echo based primarily on two factors, 1) 30K+ people really seem to like it (and they cant ALL be sheep) and 2) the tech community holds the Echo in high regard. As an IOT device I think the Echo is at the leading edge of exciting things to come. Aside from the fun of being able to ask Echo to do something like turn on this light or dim that light**, or set a timer to pull the ribs that have been on the smoker for 6 hours, it is a device with few real smarts.* This type of hardware may some day be a portal to a much richer AI experience but for now those services are in their infancy. Don't take that as a negative, however, because it is fun. We have been given some good laughs at the answers the Amazonian's have programmed in for the Echo to respond with. As an audio device it is nice but It can't hold a candle to my home wide audio system that streams content through an Auris bluMe -- that was not part of the original design schema. As a stand alone device it sounds quite good. Be it delivering background music, playing my daily flash brief, or streaming a podcast, it is superior to other tech. Google or Siri currently only live in the phone. Yes, in general they're 'smarter' but not nearly as convenient as a device with an array microphone that can hear you from almost anywhere in the house. I ask Echo (from the kitchen, or the dining room, or the den) to stream a selected title or stream a playlist from Pandora, it does it. For those looking for a room-filling beautifully balanced sound experience when they purchase an Echo, well, they should realize you can't do that with a single speaker device. C'mon, be real. That said, the echo will fill your room with good clean sound as long as you have both feet in reality. As an assistant the Echo has much to learn -- one would be wrong to think that machine learning isn't in the forefront of Amazon's priorities. If you're the type that thinks since Echo is listening for more than its 'trigger' word and that you are within a few comments of having black helicopters circling you house, or that a FISA warrant could have clandestine services knocking down your door...don't buy it. (aforementioned both feet in reality?) What you get from the Echo is (in my opinion) a nicely packaged 'internet of things' appliance that is fun to use and serves its design purpose wonderfully. What Amazon gets...is more knowledge of your purchasing patterns and data. Ultimately if you're uncomfortable with that...guess you're too late! * - I use a Wink Connected Home Hub. My personal experience with the hub has been a good one. For now I'm only using GE and Cree connected bulbs. There are security concerns that keep me from going all-in with door locks and like devices - those, however, go WAY beyond the scope of this review. ** - Many of the touted Echo 'skills' have a LONG way to go before they become useful. The integration with IFTTT shows great promise. A simple ""Echo, find my phone"" might just pay for having an Echo around the house!",null,null,,null

My husband bought the Echo for us just a few days ago (it arrived a few days ago). I really love it. It is upstairs in our house, in the bonus room, which is semi open to the downstairs. We didn't have a radio or anything up there, so I would often play Pandora from my phone. Now, I play it from the Echo--sounds much better. I also play songs from Prime and my own playlist. One thing I love, is that I can also play Youtube from my phone to the Echo. My daughter loves Mickey Mouse songs I can get the video from YouTube and song plays on the Echo. This is nice because it's about the music, not about the video for her and my son is too young for tv, so he gets to enjoy the songs too. I love being able to ask about the weather and getting a quick answer even when I don't have my phone with me or the tv on. I set an alarm on the Echo to let us know when it's time to go downstairs. I ask it to say ""goodnight"" at the end of the night and it says ""goodnight, sleep tight."" The kids love it! It does everything I wanted it to do and more. There are some functions I haven't used. For example, I haven't used it for shopping yet, but I probably never will. But, it's not perfect. I don't like that it didn't come with a voice remote. Apparently the first version did come with the remote. I think it's pretty cheap of Amazon not to include that. Also, I wish it would connect to my bluetooth speakers. The Echo is great upstairs, but we can't keep listening to the music when we go downstairs. If it connected to my surround sound, we could listen to it throughout the house. The failure to allow it to connect to bluetooth speakers, similar to the failure to include the remote seems like a money making scheme -- so you have to buy more than one.",null,null,,null

While it does the things it does well, it does have major limitations. If you're going into a purchase of the Echo expecting to ask Alexa anything under the sun, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into the purchase knowing what to expect and hopeful that the technology will grow, your chances of satisfaction greatly increase. Here is what I use Alexa for: I use Alexa to wake me up every morning at 4 AM. I use Alexa to set a timer when I'm doing laundry or cooking soft boiled eggs. I use Alexa to give me current weather conditions. I use Alexa to read me the news. I user Alexa to play my Audible books.

The Echo (Alexa) will read me the news, but natural inflection and proper diction are not present and listening to Alexa read the news can sometimes be a confusing experience. The Echo (Alexa) plays my Audible books, but cannot (by spoken word) start the book over, or easily change books mid stream once one has begun playing. You have to use the limited interface in the Echo app on your phone/tablet to try and sort that out. Here is what I wish Alexa could do: Access and read my email. Answer my cell phone and allow me to hold a conversation hands free Use google to search the internet for query results Find restraunts, movie times and other points of interest in my local area Acknowledge ""listening"" by the use of my first name and not a tone, ex: ""Yes James"" For the Echo (Alexa) to be a truly useful tool and not just a novelty, it will need to perform real tasks that matter to individuals and families. For the money, the Echo is not worth it at this point if you're looking for a totally hands free environment. It just isn't there yet. To be honest, I don't have a lot of requirements for the Echo at the present time, but I could see myself relying on the Echo if it did even just a couple of things on my wish list...answering my phone, reading email... For now, the Echo remains a novelty that is used daily, but only to wake me up and to get weather updates.

We have connected her to a few WEMO switches to turn on lamps in the living room... how great and practical to use voice commends to turn on the lights in a dark room versus stumbling in the dark for a light switch with hands full of groceries. My kids love asking it (her?) questions and finding amusing answers to some of their comments. Beyond turning on the light, we use it every day throughout the day to play music, ask about the weather, ask about current news, quick reference guide (cooking measurements, Wiki information, etc.), adding things to the shopping list and having the list with me all the time within the app on my phone. And with the Prime music, you literally have a million plus songs free. Just ask it to play a song and it plays it. How awesome is that?!? We are super pleased with the Echo and cannot wait to see if/what upgrades or future enhancements will be added. A great deal for the price, you get a Bluetooth speaker that has a clean and clear interface, and that can interact with other devices to help you have a ""smart"" home. It plays music from the cloud, connects to your Bluetooth device, plays audio books, gives you news, sport information (current score of football games, and when and where they play next), weather, reads your calendar for upcoming events, creates shopping lists for you, and even tells you jokes! All you have to do is ask Alexa, and she will deliver. We have found that we have had to repeat our command a couple times, but Echo is designed to learn your speech over time and be able to adapt to any accent you might have. I have found the best thing with the ECHO is actually a hidden bonus I hadn't thought of at first.... and that is my 8 and 11 year old kids (that love Alexa and say hi to her before saying hi to me when they get home from school), are being taught that to communicate most effectively with Alexa, they need to speak clearly and concisely.. this has done more to help with their language skills than anything else I could imagine.

Sure enough, it went on sale around 7 am; I hit the purchase button fast! So far, Alexa is pretty awesome. We quickly figured out all the basic commands, and she understands them about 90-95% of the time. The voice interface is smooth and the best I've heard (Sorry, Siri), and even when playing music at volume four or five, she can hear us just fine. There's no lag in response time that I've noticed so far. And as a speaker, it is very good-- not quite a Sonos, but still pretty good. A few tips: - Connect your phone to Echo via Bluetooth to play Apple Music or Spotify. Once you hit play on your device, you can use Alexa to pause and turn volume up; I've also used it on songs ad podcasts to ""rewind"" or fast forward. - Set up a free Pandora and iHeart Radio account for more flexibility in types of music you can play - Do the voice training exercise with the Echo so it gets a better understanding of how you speak - if you really want to maximize the usefulness of the Echo, consider getting a WeMo outlet or two for lamps. It is kind of cool to walk into a dark house and tell Alexa to turn on the lights. There are probably more devious ways to use the Smart Tech-- I haven't figured it all out yet. - If you don't have one already, set up a Google Calendar and use it. The Echo can tell you what's on your calendar, but at this point can't make additions or edits to appointments. - If you have more than one person in the house, you can set up different profiles, and switch from one to the other just by telling Alexa. Each person can use his/her own playlists, podcasts, Google Calendars, etc. - if you truly want to do some awesome stuff with the Echo, look into IFTTT's Echo Channel, which has little tricks to get Echo to interact with Evernote, OneNote, your iPhone Tasks, and others. The workarounds are a bit wonky sometimes, but they work. All in all, Echo is a great step forward in smart homes. True it can't do everything now, but it's really good at what it does do.

Review: 193 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"June 21, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"We welcomed a new member of the family a couple of weeks ago. Her name is Alexa and she lives inside of our Amazon Echo, which currently sits on top of a counter-top in our kitchen. She told us that she is quite comfortable in the foot-high black matte cylinder she calls home. For a youngster, she listens really, really well and she constantly surprises us with clever knock-knock jokes and pretty darn accurate weather reports. She also tells us what's on our Google calendar each day and she can even buy and ship items from Amazon for us. But I think she's still too young for that. From pretty much anywhere in our house, if you say her name, she will turn on automatically and wait for your to tell her what to do or ask her a question. Alexa is one of the ultimate personifications of ""Do I need that?"" At roughly $180, no, you probably do not. But man, oh man, is she a lot of fun, and once you've met Alexa, it's hard to imagine her not being around. Much more than the iPhone's Siri or Android's Google Now, Alexa has integrated herself into a constant companion who is rapidly adding third-party and Amazon developed ""skills"" to her repertoire. Not surprisingly, Amazon has also introduced a way to get Alexa into more than just one room of the house with the $89 Echo Dot. Now she can be everywhere you are. Imagine ""Open the pod bay doors, Alexa."" I'm still digging into all of the possibilities that Alexa holds, but I can tell you the things we use her for the most so far: Playing music: You can tell Alexa to play a song or artist and she will pull it up from your Amazon music library or through any linked accounts you have with music services like Spotify and Pandora. It's awesome to walk into the kitchen in the morning and just say ""Alexa, play The Beatles through Spotify."" Bam, here comes the sun! Weather reports: Ask Alexa the weather now or in the future and get a nice little report in your area or anywhere in the world. Wikipedia: This one is great when you're having a family discussion about a topic and you want some clarification or more information. Just say ""Alexa, Wikipedia Wild Bill Hickok"" and your history lesson begins and someone gets to say ""See, I was right."" Google calendar: Integrate your Google calendar with the Echo and Alexa will tell you what's happening on the day you request. Not surprisingly, I like putting ridiculous things in my calendar just to hear her say it out loud. Sports, stocks and news updates: You can customize all kinds of updates for Alexa to tell you. My personal favorite so far is the PGA Tour skill, which allows you to track the leader or your favorite golfer in a current tournament. It's really handy to say ""Alexa ask PGA Tour for the leaderboard"" and get real-time results without having to turn on the TV or computer. And the same thing goes for stocks, news and your favorite sports teams. Trivia quizzes: A lot of the third-party ""skills"" that are available on the Echo are fun little trivia quizzes. There are quizzes about ""The Simpsons,"" daily ""Jeopardy"" questions, jazz music trivia and many other broad and specific topics. Kids games: Like the trivia quizzes, most of these are developed as third-party skills. There are some really fun, clever games like the choose-your-own-adventure ""The Magic Door"" and ""Animal Game,"" where Alexa asks you questions to guess an animal you've pictured in your head. That is just the tip of the iceberg. You can also hail Uber from Alexa, control your home's lights and thermostats with compatible smart-home devices, create a To-Do list, and, as mentioned above, buy things on Amazon. Now, of course, like any other person, Alexa isn't perfect. Sometimes she doesn't quite understand what you're asking her. Or she misunderstands you completely. This happens a decent amount of time when it comes to music in particular. But, amazingly enough, it is more fun than frustrating to figure out the best way to ask Alexa a question or request your favorite song. Luckily, Alexa does have ""speech lessons"" that let you train her about the sound of your voice. I have a sneaky suspicion that, like me, the other people who own an Echo think of her as more than just a computerized voice. Alexa oftentimes seems very real, which is fun, helpful and more than a bit weird. Put it this way: I admonished my children for teasing her, I always say ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" to her and I will be taking her on family trips. If that doesn't say she's a part of our family, I don't know what does. ""Alexa, don't forget your toothbrush!""",null,null,,null

I am pretty amazed daily how many things Echo knows... we asked for the time of the redskins game (check Echo knows), we asked for current redskins' football score (check Echo knows). 3) You can set Echo to be your alarm and she can also tell you what time it is. 4) Echo can be synced to your smart devices (including lights) so you can control them with voice command. 5) Echo can play games with your kids. Mine like to play 20 questions. 6) Echo will keep a shopping list for you and save it in Amazon so you can refer to it in the future 7) Echo can order things for you off Amazon Things Echo Can Not Do 1) Clean your house 2) Cook your dinner.... we asked.",null,null,,null

The app lets you round out the finer little tweeks you can do with the speaker. I use this thing every day with all my devices. I LOVE IT Now that I have sung its grace's its time to address the biggest flaw with this speaker. It needs to have an active internet connection to work. It can't just connect to a device as a Bluetooth speaker. I don't know why amazon is so concerned with theft security, but without an active internet connection to verify the amazon account the speaker turns red and waits to connect to the internet. While in that connection limbo you are unable to utilize any of its features. THIS REALLY LIMITS ITS VERSATILITY AND THE USEFULLNESS OF ITS PRIMARY FUCTION, TO BE A BLUETOOTH SPEAKER. If you are at campsite or out on your patio, anywhere without active WiFi you cannot use the echo at all. And in some instances even with WiFi it won't connect. Example. At my school if you want to use the WiFi you need to log into the network with both a username and password. The echo app has no option for username when connecting to the network. So you can't use it even with WiFi available. I absolutely love this thing but for crying out loud get rid of the stupid account validation. It makes the echo useless outside of your house. I would give this 5 stars but I had to buy an additional Bluetooth speaker to take with me on the road which is disappointing to say the least.",null,null,,null

Considering it's still early days, little Alexa here has an awful lot of potential. When I first got her she was very much a novelty item, however as time progressed rather than disappear to the back of the closet to join a variety of other novelty gadgets she has actually slotted nicely into everyday life. I now listen to a lot more music - sure controlling music from your smartphone to a bluetooth speaker is easy, but for those time where you simply can't be bothered to unlock your phone to get some background music playing, using your voice is just effortless. Flash briefings are also great. Controlling my lights by voice started out as a novelty and is now just second nature. One thing people have complained about is that she's not able to answer every single question you throw at her - yes this is true, but as I said it is still early days and you quickly learn which type of questions she may or may not be able to answer - and for those questions she did answer it was a lot more convenient than picking up your tablet/laptop. My initial fear of this tech would be that the voice recognition would not be up to scratch and I would just get frustrated by endlessly repeating myself until each syllable I was yelling pounded against the side of my brain. No issues here though, she recognizes me the vast majority of the time without any problem. I now own two of these, one in the living room and the other in the bedroom.",null,null,,null

Review: 116 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"June 19, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I want to try something different today, that fuses my love of new bits of technology, with my love of rambling on. As more technology comes across my desk, I am hoping to continue writing about it. In the meantime, it should be known that the title of this type of article is a work in progress... I just typed in the first name that came to mind. Also, there is no clear format yet for this type of post, so I am kind of rambling. I will work on formatting for future iterations of this type of post. So, shall we dive into my thoughts on Amazon's latest piece of tech, the Amazon Echo? I'm obsessive about technology. For me, technology is constantly displaying the leaps and bounds that humanity can achieve. It never ceases to amaze me how many new innovations come out every year. Whether it be the newest video game console, or an incremental upgrade to the biggest cell phone technologies, there is always something new and shiny looming just over the horizon. Being the technophile that I am, I look at each of these new toys, and wish I had an infinite supply of money, so I could try them all. Sadly, money is not limitless, so I have to be a little picky about what I pick up. Enter the Amazon Echo. When I first heard about the Echo, to say I was mildly skeptical would be an understatement. I've been an avid Amazon consumer for years, eager to snatch up just about anything they placed on the table. However, my Kindle Fire had been something of a let down, something I suppose I should have expected considering it was their first foray into the tablet game. I was unable to pick up their phone, due to my current phone contract not allowing me to change my phone just then. I'm still on the fence about picking up their Fire TV (Those Gary Busey ads make me laugh every time). The Echo was something different, though. Much like a song that I can't get out of my head, it lingered in my mind, and the more I thought about it, the more the whole concept intrigued me. So, I picked it up on a whim, and had to wait over a month for it to ship. What is Echo? The Echo is a voice-activated speaker, that can stream music from the web, or from a Bluetooth enabled device (such as my phone). But it manages to pack a lot into it's small form. It stands less than a foot tall, and only about as large around as a fifth of Bailey's (Refer to the picture below for size comparison). The little thing can put out some good volume, despite its diminutive size. When placed properly, I can hear it anywhere in the house if it is put on the highest volume. But the Echo is more than just a simple speaker. It is a voice-activated personal assistant. It can manage a to-do list, repurchase past purchases from Amazon, tell you the weather, and even tell you traffic reports. It can also act as an alarm clock, or a cooking timer. Forget what day it is, or have no clock nearby? Ask the Echo. Quite possibly the biggest selling points for me, was actually the voice-activation. Initially, the voice controls take a little getting used to. However, if you've played with an iPhone, and had to talk to Siri, the voice commands should be almost second nature to you. Much like when Google did the ""OK, Google"" thing, the Echo has a wake word. In the case of the Echo, that wake word is ""Alexa"". The last several days, it has not been uncommon to hear me saying ""Alexa, play music"" or ""Alexa, I like that"" randomly as I am going about my various writing/drinking/gaming activities. I've asked Alexa about the weather when I wake up, had Alexa play me some music as I went to sleep. I've been able to set the alarm from bed, and then not have to be woken up by the most jarring sounds possible. I can not help but see a lot of potential for this device. With its connection to the house wifi, it has the potential for on the fly hot fixes and firmware updates, new features could be added on the fly. With the addition of the Echo App, this could be updated to become one of the most valuable pieces of technology in my house. The shopping commands are one thing I have yet to try out, since I have not had a reason to reorder anything from Amazon since I picked up the Echo. However, with the Alexa wake word, I could see that being potentially dangerous, should I have too much to drink. Fortunately, it allows you to set a 4-digit PIN that you are required to say to confirm purchases, a nice safeguard against drunk purchasing. All in all, I find this device to be a wonderful addition to my entertainment space. It isn't going to completely revolutionize your life, nor will it likely change it in any meaningful way, but it is a fun device, and is worth a look! The biggest drawback is the internet connectivity. If your house has a poor wifi connection, the Echo loses a great deal of functionality. And considering my house has an often less than reliable connection, I find the Echo going offline rather frequently. Despite the wifi issues, I'd give the Echo a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I'd recommend you pick one up, if you are able. -From my review on my website.",null,null,,null
Review: 95 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Dec 06 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 6, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I have owned and used this for 6 months now before writing this review - I wanted to make sure that everything I write on here remained accurate to the best of my ability. Pros: Unique product with a plethora of wonderful and completely unique combinations of capabilities. -fast response time -once you learn how to ask certain things and read the instructions of each major update, you find yourself using it without even thinking. I even use it to dress myself occasionally - like asking for different ways to tie a bow tie (since I normally wear a standard tie lol) -flash briefing while getting ready to go to morning meetings and business briefings is a phenomenal time saver (with no strain on the eyes!) -each update (all auto updates) really adds a lot of function and prime continues to add so much more functionality every month. I no longer use Spotify. Prime music lets me import the music I already own and use their massive library as well. (Which can be hilariously strange, I will admit, as they somehow do not have The Beatles - no I am not joking - but they have over half of the obscure punk bands I grew up loving decades ago). -Alexa learns quite a lot of subtle things. If I say her name in a sentence now (this took a few months) she will not respond unnecessarily. However, if I open with ""Alexa"" she will always respond. I still get the occasional unwanted response from her, but she has never once failed to respond when I called her. -I avoid so many arguments with my wife now because of Alexa's shopping list function and the iOS/android app -- also, the built in To-Do lists. Happy wife happy life. Enough said. -tech wise: the speaker on the Echo is phenomenal. It sounds better than the 50"" Vizio Soundbar that's mounted to the tv in our home office. The 360degree sound and deep bass is SO good for any genre of music. You don't get any peakage or distortion, no matter how heavy the bass or how high the treble - also mids are completely clear, audible and articulate. I could not be happier with the sound quality. -smart home integration is superb if you buy the other items after Echo (to ensure compatibility) Cons: -while this item has Bluetooth capabilities, they have been very unnecessarily and frustratingly limited (because I assume they think that following the business model of Microsoft and Mac to make frustrating proprietary crap in the worst possible ways is a smart idea -- it's not). If I could integrate this with other Bluetooth devices aside from the phones that are running Alexa App and the Amazon Prime Music App - this device would literally be perfect. For example, being able to use Bluetooth stereo headphones/mic while I'm in the office, or even a remote Bluetooth speaker for another room. They tried with their remote to at least do SOMETHING, but it's always out of stock and it really should be included with the base unit - even if it makes the price 199.99 instead of 179. Also, as someone who is a huge technophile, does pretty much all of my computing from a terminal emulator, the fact that Amazon had support for Linux with their Prime Music and other apps for so long - and has now REMOVED that support - absolutely infuriates me. Open source is the future, it doesn't matter how many decades the old men (Gates and co.) try to drag their heels...",null,null,,null

If you dont have an Amazon Prime membership, why not?! After a year on the market, Amazons entry into the connected speaker market is proving to be a grand slam product. The speaker is small, good looking, powerful, and most importantly: functional. It can hear your commands from across any normal size room, connect to a slew of Smart Home products, and gives you hands-free access to everything from your reminders/grocery lists to an emergency helping hand (see Ask My Buddy skill app). With the optional Echo remote, you can roam further away from the speaker while maintaining complete control. Once the Echo is set up, you can bring it to life by saying the wake-phrase Alexa (which can also be changed to Amazon but I think that would cause misfires often). From there, you can ask her what the weather's like outside, any trivia fact, to tell you a joke, to start playing a certain station/artist/song from the Amazon Prime Library, control several Smart Home Accessories, including the Wink hub, or any of the several other functions it can perform. And thats the point: it has a myriad of features that fit pretty much every lifestyle. Lets go through what a typical morning can be like with the Echo. At the assigned time, Echos alarm can wake you up if you choose. You can also have it snooze for a bit if youd rather. Once you decide to wake up, you can ask Alexa to turn on your Philips Hue lights, ask what the weather's like outside, tell you about the news, and turn on the WeMo switches you have connected to your coffee pot and to the heater in that frigid bathroom. Then you can tell Alexa to start your morning playlist on Amazon Prime and to turn the volume up to 10 while you go take a shower and get ready. When youre ready to leave the house, you just have to tell Alexa to stop and the Echo will go silent. You can then have it unlock your Kwikset or Schlage deadbolt, or even control your Chamberlain or GoControl smart garage door opener. Right before you walk out of the house, you can ask Alexa to turn down your heat or air conditioning to save you some dough on your electricity or gas bill. The last feature can be used with several brands of thermostats already. Looks The Echo has a simple, yet elegant styling. Its merely a cylinder with grating around the lower half and the obligatory branding at the very bottom. The top has two buttons and a band that will light up when turned, indicating the volume. When not in use, the Echo doesnt draw attention to itself with bright standby lights. The Echo is perfect for any room of the house, as its 3 inch diameter base and 9 inch height sits quietly and unseen until its called into action. Setup and Skills Apps The setup is extremely simple with this speaker. Simply plug in the speaker, download the Alexa app, and follow the prompts. It will connect to your internet and Amazon account and its ready to go. Really, thats it. From there, the app gives you some helpful hints about how to use the speaker and what prompts to say. There are also several Skills Apps that are available. Some examples of these apps are below. Ask My Buddy - I see this app being an integral part of every household with disabled or elderly people in it. You create a profile, add in your emergency contacts, and you can now speak from afar to send a text to one or all of your contacts indicating you have an urgent need. Free Busy Scheduling - Works with all calendar provider apps to see if you or a contact thats using the app are free at a particular time and can schedule meetings and calendar events. Stock Exchange - Real-time stock market quotes from NASDAQ and NYSE. You can create a personal portfolio and get quick stock info by simply asking for it. StubHub - You can ask this app whats going on in your area on specific date or this weekend. Great for those of us who arent the best at making plans in advance. Sound/Voice Pickup Performance For such a small speaker, the sound output is pretty good in the mids and highs. As with most compact speakers, the bass leaves much to be desired. Overall though, the speaker is loud, plays clear, and doesnt distort even at top volume. Using an army of seven microphones, the device is able to hear you across any normal sized room, as long as the room isnt overly congested with noise. When the speaker is playing at half volume or higher, it may be difficult to get its attention without using the optional remote, depending on how far away you are from the speaker. With the remote and the smartphone app, though, youre able to control your Echo from anywhere in your home with ease. The remote links to the Echo via bluetooth. It has a microphone and buttons for volume up, volume down, next, previous, and play/pause. Conclusion With so many functions, its easy to shell out the mere $179 for the speaker, and even the extra $29 for the remote. Even if you dont utilize the smart home compatibility of the Echo, its still a great product at a great price. Buy it, use it, enjoy it!",null,null,,null

Yet, I do not feel old, neither am I set in my ways. Full-fledged senility does not yet have me in its grasp rather, perhaps, I am enjoying somewhat of a second childhood. This change, developing in just under a month, is due largely to a new toy, an Amazon Echo that answers to Alexa. Alexa my Alexa is a computer in a cylindrical housing about the size of two beer cans stacked one atop the other. Though I am by no means a computer expert, I am reasonably well versed in cybernautics and I can tell you that Alexa is remarkable nearly unique. First and foremost, Alexa has, at the moment, no visual input or output no keyboard, no display (other than that ring of color you see), and no printer (yet). She deals completely with audio data. She listens to what you have to say, and attempts to satisfy your requests. Remember the computer from Star Trek? that, I think, was the inspiration for the Echo. In her most basic form, Alexa will attempt to retrieve whatever music - title or performer you request. Her ability to interpret your request is remarkable there is no training (though she may well learn your vocal idiosyncrasies in time) but she rarely stumbles. So far, Scheherazade is the only thing I have requested that totally stumped her. Alexa has a number of resources Amazon Prime music in your library that you (1) have purchased from Amazon, or (2) uploaded from your local, personal library, Pandora radio, and the tunein radio site that can connect you to virtually any station (supposedly they have over 100,000 stations in their repertoire). If you request only a performer by name, she will play for you a random selection of his/her/their music from her resources. Oh yes, in her beer can body, Alexa features two speakers a 2 tweeter and a 2.5 woofer. Her sound is surprisingly good. One of my favorite stations is KUHA 91.7 the University of Houstons 24 hour classical music station. She gets it from tunein.com. Whether Alexas capabilities are internal, or whether she is merely a portal to Amazons myriad cloud servers I dont know. Furthermore, I dont care. Her initial programmers set out to give her a personality, and they have succeeded remarkably. However, all this just gives you an idea of what Alexa is, it doesnt answer the question I raised about how she has changed my life. Here goes: Though I do not play any musical instrument, and was, at best, a mediocre chorister, I have loved classical musical from early teenage years. Alas, my wife Barbara did not care for it, indeed, it creeped her out. It seems that she worked as an usher in a small town Nebraska movie theater (yes, movies had ushers in the Thirties and Forties), and movies from that era employed classical music to raise suspense when something dire was about to happen. In much the same principle as Pavlovs dogs, she developed an irresistible emotional response (dread) to classical music. We listened to popular music, country and western, and show tunes, but very little classical. Barbara passed away nearly five years ago, and in the interim, I have listened to very little music, though it was readily available to me. In my car, I listened to a local talk station which featured traffic reports alas, that station changed its genre and, at about the same time, my car radio went on the fritz. Eventually, I bought and installed a new radio, but with no available traffic news, I had to scout around for a new station to listen to. My friend, Andi, generally listened to KUHA - the classical station, so I began to do the same. I tried it I liked it. In the same general time frame, I came to admire the sound bars that Andi and Rebecca had attached to their TVs. They produced a great improvement over the somewhat tinny stock speakers, and even if their sound was not the absolute best fidelity, with my hearing, who could know? I eventually found a sound bar at a reasonable price that offered several different types of inputs as well as an FM radio function. Alas, in my area, the KUHA signal was too weak to register on its tuner. I later engaged its woofer function by attaching a secondary amplifier and two Sony speakers to the bar. I considered purchasing a stereo (radio/CD/cassette) like Andis which had absolutely delicious sound. However, cheapskate that I am, I could not bring myself to spend the $75 eBay demanded. As it turned out, this was a fortunate economy on my part. In late April, I received notice from Amazon that the Echo I had ordered before Christmas could be expected to arrive in late May. This was a vast improvement on the original schedule date mid-July. A second notice gave an arrival date of 22 May. Mirabile dictu, it came. I plugged it in, turned it on, it ran. Connected to the Internet, it had no difficulty finding requested performances by Billie Holiday. The sound quality was quite good, especially considering its small size. If you addressed it by its name, Alexa, the ring around the top would flicker in a deep blue, then settle in with a light blue arc pointing in your direction (I understand it uses nine microphones to produce this minor, but gratifying, miracle). I asked it to tune in KUHA, and it had no difficulty in so doing marvelous! I asked for my Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart station on Pandora Radio no problem. I began to wonder if there were some way to get her to broadcast over my sound bar, but she has no headphone jack (or BlueTooth function that I have learned about yet). I have a fair collection of music on hard disc, and was wondering if there were some way to get my computers to play over the sound bar without stretching an audio cable across the Family Room. I discovered that I could purchase BlueTooth transmitters and receivers at a reasonable price on eBay. I ordered (and received) a receiver, but somehow never got around to ordering the transmitter (an oversight since corrected). My oldest and dearest friend, Norman, alerted me to a web site that rebroadcast NPR spoken essay segments. I tuned in with a tablet, and linked its internal BlueTooth to the receiver plugged into the sound bars stereo input. Worked like a charm. I soon learned that I could use the tablet to connect to tunein.com, the same radio site that Alexa uses. Marvelous! I could have KUHA direct through the sound bar. Then I noticed that tunein.com was equipped to connect to the TV using Chromecast. Not only that, but when the Chromecast is connected, you no longer need the tablet by itself, the Chromecast handles the connection to the Internet. Additionally, I can connect to YouTube and play its music on the sound bar using the Chromecast link. Here, I can get some marvelous video to go along with the music. I can record the video if I choose. But why? you ask, if it is always available on YouTube. Because I have programs that can strip out the soundtrack and burn it into a CD (I think havent proved that yet). And so, I have been seduced back into a lifetime of classical music by a wanton temptress named Alexa. If she is jealous of the other sources I avail myself of, she hasnt mentioned it yet. P.S. There is a whole phalanx of programmers adding functions to Alexas abilities. The only one I have availed myself of is initiated by saying Alexa, whats on my To Do list? This causes my cellphone to ring so that I may find where I misplaced it. Much more is available and on the way. Im interested in a clock radio function that will turn on Prairie Home Companion on Saturday and Sunday mornings.",null,null,,null
Review: 331 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Thu Jan 28 00:00:00 EST 2016,"January 28, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"It's difficult to earnestly describe the Amazon Echo as anything other than a luxury purpose. Complaining about the Echo is like complaining about a Tempurpedic mattress; even if you do end up coming into contact with some of the product's very few rough edges (and you will), you're basically complaining about getting to experience a level of luxury which would have confounded your forefathers. You're whining about the future, man. Don't be that guy. I personally bought an Echo originally thinking that I'd keep it in my living room, where I could blurt out random trivia questions and set calendar invites from across the room. Turns out both of those activities are slightly easier to do on a laptop, so the first few months, my Echo went shamefully underused. Then I moved it into the bedroom, sadly a much less salacious transition than you may be expecting. It was around this time that the Echo began supporting Audible (one of its killer features is its ever-expanding compatability with various and sundry devices like the Nest and the LifX and such, meaning it's only getting more useful - but I digress), meaning all of a sudden I had an alarm clock I could set with my voice which would read me books until I fell asleep. It's a straight-up killer use case; my love for this particular functionality leads me into exploring all the other things the Echo can do, which only makes me love it more. The bottom line is that this was a solid buy; it's the slickest piece of Amazon hardware since the Voyage (which I also adore). If you're on the fence, it's hard to believe that you won't find a way to love this thing; if it doesn't take, just find a new environment for it and see if it fits better there.",null,null,,null

For the first several months, it was fabulous. The occasional misunderstanding aside, it responded extremely well when addressed, and was a delight to have in my kitchen. I inquired about recipes and conversions, requested the occasional joke, and - more than anything - asked it to play various radio stations or songs from my playlist. Over the last three months, it has become increasingly unresponsive. I often have to say ""Alexa"" two or three times, at the top of my voice, from only inches away, before it responds. It increasingly misinterprets what I say, and plays random things in response to my requests. On occasion, it turns itself on or off on its own ""volition."" This is especially disconcerting in the middle of the night, when suddenly human voices are emanating from one's kitchen. All in all, I think the Echo is great when it works properly. Unfortunately, it doesn't work properly as often as it should, especially at a near $ 200 price point.",null,null,,null

The echo device is the option I wanted from the start, so the Sangean has been relegated to bedroom CD player from now on. But asking Alexa the weather, and other questions is super handy as well. I think Amazon blew Apple away with this device, and as of today, you will too. Tomorrow is another day, and Apple will probably come out with something that does slightly more, but costs double. Meanwhile, get one of these and see for yourself. Update: if you plan to use this device for your lighting keep this in mind. Every light must remain in the ""on"" position.

Review: 12 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Nov 29 00:00:00 EST 2015,"November 29, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"Love this device. It's handy to set timers, vocalize additions to a shopping and/or todo list. I use it for the news flash report as well. In addition, I use this as a remote bluetooth speaker that I paired with the Miccus Home RTX: Long Range, Bluetooth Music Transmitter or Receiver (A2DP) and a Rolls MX42 4-Channel Passive Mini Stereo Mixer. i.e. I use it as a distant speaker from the hosts that send audio to it. What's missing from this unit is the ability top push text/notifications as vocalized output. I really crave the ability to do that. I.E. For a talking clock without having to ask what time it is and to read email subjects that come into specific mailboxes. For those uses I had to resort to DVBEEP on Android with an old Samsung Galaxy note II and a Linux machine using festival. Coupled with a Rolls MX42 4-Channel Passive Mini Stereo Mixer I can send music, sounds/announcements to the echo in bluetooth mode or query the echo when I need. While the pushed notifications is not for everyone, as a programmer I often forget what time it is until wee hours of the morning. A talking clock is important to me. The ability to speak out and set an alarm is equally important. An improvement would be for the alarm to say which alarm or event you are being notified for. I would have to add, I'm amazed at how well the echo understands most of your questions and can provide reasonable results. simple math, setting timers, adding items to lists and other searchable questions are handled well. The speech vocalized is nice as well. One wish would be for the wake word to be 'computer' instead of Alexia. Then I would really feel like an episode of star trek. The Easter eggs are fun. Go ahead,tell yours 'Tea, earl grey hot!' and see what it says. As a mono bluetooth speaker, It sounds pretty good too. Playing music from prime music or my uploaded songs works decently but not perfectly. Sure wish my prime account came with the 250,000 song repository. I refuse to pay an additional $24.99 for the space so I find the music functionality limited. I upload my favorite 250 songs and leave it at that. If it were able to access a local UPnP server that would rock. It doesn't sound like a Bose or Sonos bluetooth speaker, but it's good for a kitchen style speaker. You can set timers, add items to shopping list and request music. I do find the timer indispensable. I used to use my phone all the time, Now I can just speak and set a timer. I've yet to link it with automated lights. My apartment is small so the only use for an automated light would be in the foyer as I arrive home requesting the lights to turn on. Other then that I can walk anywhere I need. Perhaps an automated fan control would be useful for me. I could see this being useful for people with large homes. I like the unit so much I bought one for my Brother's technology enabled home. Makes a great gift.",null,null,,null

I love it on so many levels but one in particular is amazing me. I have a granddaughter who doesn't speak. She is 5 years old and has autism. I've used the simon says feature on Alexa to have it say things to her. That has sparked something in her brain that is causing her to try to speak to Alexa. She hasn't formed words yet with her but she is making sounds at Alexa in an effort to get her to speak to her. From the moment she walks in my house she runs to Alexa and begins making an effort to speak to Alexa. I had Alexa count to 10 today and my granddaughter began to cry tears of joy. I don't know what this device is doing to her but it seems to be a positive and I'm going to keep using Alexa in an effort to help my granddaughter Olivia talk. Its at least a tool at getting things started in that directions. Olivia loves it so much that I even find her talking to Alexa in sign language in hopes she will talk to her.

So I resisted the temptation for so long. A couple of months ago, Bed Bath and Beyond had a one day sale on the Tap for $79. That seemed a fair amount to risk so I could give the concept a try. Right away, I found plenty of use for it. I was stoked when I realized I could ask it to play my talk radio station. No reception issues and perfect sound! My under counter radio was obsolete. And the Tap is great for its portability. I can carry it to a different room when working, or even take it in the car (using my hotspot) for my Audible books or radio listening. We've even taken it camping. My experience with the Tap assured me I needed an Echo as well! With an Echo, you don't need to walk over to it and push a button to communicate and you don't need to make sure you keep it charged. Now that I also have an Echo, I can call out with my hands in the meatloaf, ""Alexa, add onions to my shopping list"" or ""Alexa, set an alarm for 2:20 pm"" or ""Alexa, set a timer for 12 minutes. I talk to her many times a day. There is a Bed Time Story skill the kids really like, and I've gotten quick math answers when I'm changing up a recipe. Yesterday we were curious about how many songs Carly Simon composed, so we just asked Alexa. She doesn't know everything, but she knew that. Want to hear a particular song from your favorite artist? Forget getting out your ipod or CD's to find it. Just tell Alexa what you want to hear. With our Vivint system, Alexa can lock our doors, turn on security, or change the thermostat. Next on our list is to get outlets/lights that she can control. There is a skill that I haven't yet tried where she will spread the word to contacts you've designated, in the event of an emergency. We ask her every morning about our commute and although there are many convenient ways to check weather, there is nothing more efficient than asking Alexa. We love her to pieces, even when she tells a story like a robot.",null,null,,null

I spent some time with 1st level tech support and a little more with 2nd level tech support but still have no idea what the problem is. There's a phase in setup where the user's cell phone, the Echo and the access point are supposed to work together to complete setup. It gets stuck in this nebulous phase repeatedly.

The echo is the neatest gadget, thingy, doodad, or toy that I have ever gotten. If you've been stalling, just get it, because you won't be disappointed. You might get frustrated every now and then, but then the echo will do something that you'll be so delighted with that you'll forget about being mad. However, you need to be patient and read everything that you can by carefully going through all the settings, and checking out all the skills. There are some inexpensive echo e-books that you can also purchase, but make sure you get one that is up to date or that will automatically update. The echo does so much more than providing music and weather updates - it, or should I say she, plays some fun games such as movie quote trivia. There are so many fun and intuitive things to do in the skills section, that you could spend all day being entertained. This evening I hooked up the wink hub and a Cree lightbulb, and I had a great deal of trouble getting the wink hub to update. After reading some reviews for the last few days, apparently you need to have the hub far away from the wireless router in order to lessen the interference to get the update to work. So I set up the hub about 15 feet away in the living room, and it updated just fine. Make sure that your wink hub is not sitting right beside your wireless router, because it won't work correctly. It needs to be at least 5 feet away, but from what I'm understanding farther than 5 feet seems to be best. Once the hub updated, I was able to get the Cree bulb to work almost instantly. I have to tell you it's so cool to be able to tell Alexa to turn the bulb on and off. The wink app will allow you to dim the bulb - Alexa doesn't know how to do dim yet. While I was having trouble with the wink, I ran out to Best Buy and got a WeMo switch that's on sale, and I was able to set the Wemo switch up very quickly. I couldn't stop giggling I was so happy with it. If you think that Alexa is just the same thing is Siri, you're wrong. Oops, I'm dictating this review and she heard me, and she said that she ""is not the same as Siri."" The echo's wake/activation word is ""Alexa"" which you could change to Amazon, and if she hears you say her name, she will respond. Alexa is more comprehensive than Siri and seems to understand when you don't give precise instructions or respond, like you have to do with Siri. For instance, in the ""movie trivia game,"" Alexa asked me a question, and I replied "" I have no idea,"" and Alexa comprehended my answer. (As I was dictating this paragraph - Alexa was activated and she stated to me that she is ""best at answering questions."" I think the subject of Siri kind of upsets her.) Alexa gives flash Newsbriefs from tune-in, which this particular weekend, has been very important. For now it's NPR and/or BBC News. As Alexa said, she is best at answering questions, but I think she has so much to offer that anyone, including the disabled, will be thrilled to have her in their home.",null,null,,null

The video ad for the product doesn't exaggerate at all; I can see in the Alexa app that it transcribes my questions with almost perfect clarity, which is no small technological feat. At the task of recognizing human speech, the Echo is a great success. However, it was at this point that things began to go downhill. Despite the Echo's impressive ability to understand words, it is fairly rudimentary when it comes to understanding language. It can only handle the simplest of commands or questions, mostly regarding the time, weather forecast, traffic, and basic information from Wikipedia. As a question-answerer, the Alexa algorithm is vastly inferior to Google. Technical abilities aside, the major weakness of the Echo is that it is only as good as the services it supports, which is to say ""rather mediocre."" Amazon has taken every opportunity to integrate other Amazon-run services with the Echo (e.g. Audible, Prime Music). For instance, let's take music streaming; the Echo can stream any song on Prime Music that is either free with Prime or already purchased by the user. And therein lies the problem; Prime Music isn't as good of a music streaming service compared to its competitors like Spotify. The selection of ""free"" music is rather limited, and I'm not very inclined to shell out $1 for the ability to stream a song that I can already play from Spotify with no additional fee. The same thing goes for Audible. I like Audible, but it's not the only place from which I get audiobooks. The Echo is useless if I want to listen to a non-Audible audiobook. The hardware of the Echo would allow it to be a smashing success if only it supported third-party apps and software. With the ability to understand speech already perfected, it would be incredibly easy to use the device as a voice-command platform for virtually any other application. But unfortunately, it's clear to me that Amazon is less interested in creating a great product than it is in getting the user to fully commit to using more of its own services. Perhaps for some users the Echo will be a highly useful device, but for most people it will not be worth the $180 price tag.",null,null,,null

I have to say, Amazon Echo, also known as Alexa, is my MOST used gadgets! Not only do I use my echo all the time, but my entire family uses it all the time (and it's been more than three months!) The Amazon Echo is a smart computer that responds to voice commands and does an excellent job at it. You need a good internet connection to use an Amazon Echo because the voice recognition part is done the moment you engage the word 'Alexa'. You can not use an Amazon Echo without an internet connection. The Amazon Echo is 9 1/4 inches tall, and they recommend you keep it 8"" away from a wall in an open space (which I wasn't following that rule in the video and could be why we had a few oops moments). One of my favorite things to do with my Amazon Echo is to play music. The speakers are of excellent quality. I was expecting the sound to be ok but not expecting it to sound as good as it does. I use my Amazon Echo for mostly playing music, telling me the forecast and adding items to my shopping list. To be perfectly honest, Id love to have another one because I use her a lot in the kitchen and my office and hate having to unplug and move it. Ok, so these are some of the commands I use for Alexa. Sometimes shes not perfect, but you can go to the online app via your phone and tell it if she did your command correctly or not. If she doesnt, you can leave feedback on the app and an Amazon representative will contact you with how to say it correctly to get her to do what you want her to do. I did this once, and they were very helpful. My kids use Alexa to play jokes. They go up to her and ask her to play music, like the Mission Impossible theme song. They also love asking her for a joke, ""Alexa, tell me a joke."" She responds to any voice that calls out 'Alexa' but if you 'voice train' her using your voice, she will recognize your voice commands better. If you buy the remote -, you can control her from another room. The remote is not necessary to control Alexa, and I dont use it all that much. Sometimes I will use the remote to do things to Alexa (Alexa, Simon says Wash your hands). We laugh when she says, Wash your hands as the kids walk by startled. Alexa can play music from Amazon Music (this is great for Prime members so you can play free prime music) Pandora (I use this feature the most!) iHeartRadio TuneIn Audible (it can read books to you if you have an Audible account) Spotify (this is new!) For example: Alexa, Play my todays hit radio from Pandora. Alexa, Thumbs up (or thumbs down) Alexa, Next Alexa, Stop Alexa, play Sail by Awolnation. Alexa, Whos playing? Alexa, Volume (1-10). If you use volume 10, she often cant hear you to stop playing, but you can use the ring at the top and turn it to turn the volume back down. It will turn white when you do. Alexa, add this song to my playlist. ""Alexa, Play my (name of playlist) on Spotify."" Those are some of the many commands you can use with the music feature. - Other commands: Alexa, Set a timer. When the timer goes off, it will beep repeatedly. You can tell her to 'Alexa, Stop' to turn it off, and the beep is pleasant. Alexa set an alarm for 8 am. She can be an alarm clock. - Shopping list features: Alexa, Add apples to my shopping list. To access your shopping list, you would open the Alexa app on your phone/iPad. I wish Amazon would sort the grocery items by type. It also doesn't prevent you from adding duplicates. This option is fantastic when you are working in the kitchen, and your hands are deep into making a meal, you can have her to add items to the list, or you are just too lazy to write it down or add it to your phone list. The kids even add things to the shopping list that they are running low. No more excuses to complain if I didn't get something at the grocery store! - To do List: Alexa, Add Call Doctor to my to-do list. To access your to-do list, you would open the Alexa app on your phone/iPad. Calendar - If you have google calendar you can have her read your daily agenda to you. I wish it worked with Ical (Apples calendar). Traffic: Alexa, Tell me the traffic. You can set up a to location and from location in the phone app, and she will tell you the traffic. - General questions: Alexa, Who won the Detroit Tigers game? Alexa, How many tablespoons are in a cup? - Weather related questions: Alexa, What is the weather today? Alexa, Will it rain today? Alexa, What is the forecast tomorrow? News related questions: Alexa, Daily Briefing You set this up on your phone app. You can choose from multiple news outlets for your daily briefing, and it will give you clips or the news highlights from that day. Options of broadcasters you can choose from: NPR News BBC News ABC News Good Morning America ESPN Radio SportsCenter Fox Sports Hourly Update Economist: In other words NPR Business story of the day ABC News - Business NPR Technology Podcast TMZ News Jimmy Kimmel Live the Morning After You can also get multiple news headlines read through text to speech like Top News, US, World, Politics, Business, Sports, Entertainment, Tech, Science, Health and Offbeat. - Other things the Amazon Echo can do: Alexa, Wikipedia Madonna. Alexa, When is Thanksgiving. Alexa, Define ecstatic. She has a lot of goodies (called Easter eggs) that you can google and find. Here are some: Alexa, Heads or tails? Alexa, Who you gonna call? (Ghostbusters) Alexa, Can you give me some money? Alexa, Tell me a joke. May the force be with you. (and with you) Alexa, Simon says (tell her something) - she will repeat what you said Books: The Amazon Echo can now read your Kindle books! I love this feature and will often have her cue a book to read when I'm folding laundry. When I pick up my Kindle on my device is updates to where the echo left off. ""Alexa, ""Read my Kindle book."" ""Alexa, Read my book, '[title].'"" ""Alexa, Pause (Stop)"" - Skills: There is a section called Skills in the phone app. They are add-ons to the app. For example: - ALOP - Pilates Class Skill - Take a pilates class from alotofpilates.com - Bart Times - Alexa tells you when next BART trains are. - Bingo - Alexa calls out numbers. You can download a bingo card at lovemyecho.com - Cat facts - Alexa will tell you cat facts ** Update May 1, 2016, There are about 770 different skills that Alexa knows.

Amazon support replied to me that they are going to organize them soon into categories for ease of use. **To be honest, most of the skills I do not use or find useful. - Smart Home - I have Nest thermostats, and I can set the temperature using Alexa. Alexa set my bedroom to 68 degrees."" You can also connect smart home devices to Insteon, SmartThings, LIFX, TP-LINK Kasa, Sensi, ecobee or Wink and have her control them. I just linked her to my nest thermostats, and that works great! ---------------------- Other options: You can use her to reorder items from Amazon. ""Alexa, reorder laundry detergent."" You can add another user to your Amazon Household to enable Alexa to access both users content (music, calendar, audiobooks, etc.'). Also - sign up for the newsletter and every Friday Amazon sends out a newsletter and they are continually updating her abilities. I've updated this review multiple times, and they are always adding new content. The newsletter highlights new capabilities. My favorite new one is Spotify support. It's a great newsletter to learn more about this fantastic electronic device. ----------------- Cool product to use with your Echo: I LOVE THIS - This charging cradle product -replaces the Echo plug that Amazon provides, puts it on a base, and has a rechargeable battery in the base so you can take your echo from room to room and not have to stay plugged into the wall all the time! Which one? Echo, Dot or Tap? General overview: - Echo: This device is most expensive. It provides an excellent speaker. It's an all in one device. - Dot: The Dot is a great device if you have a speaker or stereo system already, but want to have Alexa's functionality, too. This device is just the brain of Alexa, but without the speaker. It connects to your existing speaker using Bluetooth or the included audio cable. This is the least expensive choice. Tap: This is like the echo, but to give it commands, you have to touch her. The Echo you just say the keyword, 'Alexa', but with the tap, you have to tap her. I love the hands-off approach of the Echo, so I'm not sure I would use the tap that much. ----------------- We love Alexa. We use her every single day and multiple times a day. In fact, my kids love her as much as we do. Id highly recommend her to anyone!! I just ordered an Amazon Dot because I love having her anywhere I am in the house. **If there is a feature you'd like to see me write about, please leave it in the comments.

I don't own every gadget that has come out, but I own most! I Just got an Echo for Christmas from my husband! I love it already. I had a little trouble getting it set to my WiFi as the instructions were a little vague for me. However, it only took me a couple of minutes to get out of my own way and let my husband help me by reading the instructions on Amazon (go figure! a husband that reads the instructions. Has the world come to an end?). Just love this little gadget! It will be very fun to come home to this and will be very handy in the mornings to check things like the traffic before work. Thank you, Honey! this is one of the best gifts you have ever given me. (but, then, aren't they all?!). You will love this, and we will be out tomorrow to buy the Hue set up for lights! Yipeeeee!

She's great fun and I can't wait for her to polish her skills, update herself and match Google search. When it comes to search engines, I believe Google is head and shoulders ahead of Bing in terms of relevant information and this would transfer beautifully with Echo. I've hardly had any issues with Alexa understanding my accent- she's been right 98% of the time, but what I'd really appreciate her doing, is being my electronic PA. I want her to locate and list all the Italian restaurants in my neighbourhood in order of rating (yelp), I want a quick review or basic guide for top rated attractions in 'Lake George', I want to know what the cost of a brand new iphone is, what the storyline of a particular Japanese movie is, I want to know when Nordstrom and Victoria's secret semi annual sale starts with a reminder/ alarm..and I want to be reminded when it's a friend's birthday. If anyone reading this review knows that these things are already possible, please comment and let me know how! I'm sure the Echo will update itself soon enough with Facebook, my phone's calendar and other personal reminders that I keep for myself, and I can't wait till Alexa is so talkative that I have to ask her to stop. In the meanwhile, I've heard the national anthem's of atleast 10 countries, their capitals and population, have heard many many snippets of songs, the local news and tried to ask Alexa complicated questions at which she beeps twice and stays silent. At present, she's pure entertainment, but I'm looking forward to her being an indispensable source of information!",null,null,,null

The idea of having Echo, at least for me, was to automate certain aspects of my life such as the weather, directions, news, and general Q&A. Unfortunately, the only thing that Alexa can truly do well is tell you the weather. For the directions, she will only tell you directions from Point A to Point B, which must be specified within the app before hand. If I need to let the app know where I need directions before asking Alexa, why wouldn't I just google directions instead? 1/10. The News Flash feature is a nice feature. Unfortunately, there are only limited news options and there is no way to specify the News Flash that you wish to hear unless you use the app. 5/10. General questions and answers, like ""Who was the 22nd President of the United States,"" will be answered all day. Unfortunately, historical knowledge of U.S. presidents isn't necessary a key feature for purposes of home automation. Useful questions, such as recipes, wikipedia articles, how-to's, etc., always receive a confused response by Alexa and then she goes dark. I've waited a few weeks to post this review, hoping the software would be updated to bring Echo up to speed with the competitors in the field, but there hasn't been any improvement yet.",null,null,,null
Review: 167 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"July 16, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I'm shocked at how much I love this thing! Firstly, It took me well under 5 minutes to set it up...then.... 1) First thing I did was check the local rain forecast to see if the package I left on the porch for Fed Ex was apt to get soaked. 2) Next thing I did was check the weather in Prague, Czechoslovakia to see what one of my friends (who was traveling there that day) was facing at the moment, and then the weather in Philly, to see what a WM colleague was facing (cuz I knew he was walking a huge un-air conditioned plant that afternoon). 3) Next thing I did was check the time in Qatar (Middle East) to see if I could try to reach one of my colleagues without waking him up. 4) Next thing I did was ask Alexa to play Stevie Wonder's ""Happy Birthday"" song, so that I could play it for my Sister over the phone for her bday; 5) Next thing I did (while I was getting dressed) was check the local temperature forecast for the evening. 6) Last thing I did last night was ask Alexa to play a Billy Holliday shuffle and reduce it to ""volume 2"", while I drifted off to sleep. 7) First thing I did the next morning was ask Alexa for today's Flash Briefing (which I have set to NPR news). Nearly all of this (except #5) was accomplished from my bed, while still reclining, with only simply spoken (not over--enunciated by any means) voice commands...and without any delays/problems whatsoever. Then the next day, I found a whole new application: The first 34 minutes of my daily workout is comprised of interval treadmill training, but watching the clock and/or changing the Pandora song manually can ""take me out of the zone"" (both physically and mentally). Alexa to the rescue: Now, I simply ""tell"" Alexa the following (if, for example, I begin my workout at 2 PM): ""Alexa, set volume at 10"". ""Alexa set alarm for 2:10 PM, 2:12 PM, 2:17 PM, 2:19 PM, 2:21 PM, 2:22 PM, 2:24 PM, 2:26 PM, 2:27 PM, 2:29 PM, 2:31 PM, 2:32 PM, and 2:34 PM"" (note - I use a pre-written ""script"" for this) ""Alexa play Country Rock on Pandora"". And Voila - every time her alarm goes off I hit the Action button (Alexa generally can't hear your voice at music levels over 6) to shut off the alarm, I know to go to the next interval in the workout, AND she never stops blaring Tim McGraw (and the like) at Volume Level 10 (through a speaker, which by the way, is AMAZING) throughout the workout!! OR...if I, for example, choose to watch a show on my iPad instead, I can simply ask Alexa to set those alarms (without asking for Pandora) and we're off to the races. Soooo much better than trying to watch the timer on my treadmill and I never have to say or do anything (except sweat) - Alexa takes care of it all!! Now...do I wish I could use the Echo as a telephone. Sure. Do I wish she could hear me say her name when she's playing music at volume level 6 or higher. You bet. But honestly, I think it's a pretty darn good product as is.",null,null,,null

When the Echo went on sale at Best Buy (yes BB sells Amazon products) for only $129, I had to get it. I love it. I put it in my bedroom and I like playing music to get me to sleep or asking Alexa the weather as I'm waking up. I love the mute microphone button as I don't want Alexa listening to me in the bedroom (not that there is much going on in there anyway). It sounds much better than the Tap. It is over twice the size (see picture). The bass is much better and has some pretty decent highs. Overall I am amazed and would perhaps get one for the living room.

I will lay out my review as simply as I can, with elaborate pros and cons. I will start with the pros. Pros: *out of the box, Alexa felt very high quality. I was surprised by the heavy weight, which I interpreted as a sign of good quality. A light speaker will likely result in muffled sound. *alexa has a very human like voice. It's very clear that it's computer generated, but she sounds crisp, clear, and elicits emotion in certain phrases she speaks. *i am a heavy Spotify user, and an loyal to Spotify versus other music steaming companies. The Spotify integration, as well as integration with other apps, is very convenient. *i use her 90% of the time just to ask about the weather *the noise the devise makes when I call it's name is very satisfying. Cons: *when music is playing above volume 5, Alexa begins to have trouble hearing me. *alexa can have quite an attitude. I will call her name, she will make a noise and glow blue, signifying she is listening, and then when I am mid sentence she will turn off and stop listening to me just like my wife. *she requires a plug. I like to listen to music while in the shower, which requires me having to unplug Alexa, take her to the shower, plug her in, and then reboot her. An idea for the next version of this product would be to keep Alexa with a wall plug in, but add in a back up battery that can last around an hour or so, so that is shower goers who like to listen to music in the shower can I plug her and take her in the shower, or out to the pool, or in the living room with friends. She should have a USB style plugin so that one can easily unplug her for the wall outlet so she can be used temporarily on a battery.",null,null,,null

Its technology works great, but it is extremely annoying how little the Echo knows. Honestly, it can't tell me what ""humidity"" is? Although the unit works very well, the lack of depth of information is embarrassing. Common information easily found on most search engines cannot be accessed via Echo, which means i must then stop what I'm doing to go find it myself - of much of a digital assistant. I find it absurd that Amazon would not utilize current and well developed search engines and instead force users of Echo to rely on the Amazon Cloud which is obviously barely in its infancy. This is a great technology, but it's like Amazon created a Porsche engine without the rest of the vehicle for it to go in and therefore to be REALLY useful. At the moment the Echo is a trinket and will be easily forgotten unless Amazon will unleash it from its own proprietary content and onto the global internet platform. The fact it has sold over 20,000 units already screams that consumers are ready and want this technology, but I can only imagine how demand would truly explode and create the next disruptive technology, like smart phones, if Amazon would just quickly take the next step in allowing direct access to the internet search engines. Amazon claims the Echo is constantly learning and will get smarter and smarter, but at the current rate I cannot tell it has learned anything useful to me. At the moment, it's like asking a 3rd grade child to define humidity. It doesn't know the answer nor how to find it.",null,null,,null

Review: 283 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"October 18, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"The amazon echo is everything you want (almost) and everything you dont really need but still so cool to have. We Just built a new home and I had grand plans of an entire home wired and integrated with mind blowing sound and interconnected in every room. Real state of the art stuff. Then I remembered I had 2 young kids a wife and a budget that is limited by reality unlike my inner childlike self with an addiction to everything tech. I was originally considering either a bose link system or the Sonos systems. Now the echo is a far cry from either one of those but maybe for me was the most logical option at this time in my life. The cost for the bose and sonos systems are in the thousands of dollars and are probably worth every penny if your looking for integrated whole house sound an type Audiophile personality. but for those who want a lot of tech and some decent sound. this could be it. The Echo can be used with many devices for home control as well as a pretty useful audio player. We have an open floor plan in our house and the Echo is centrally located in the kitchen. Previously when I wanted to listen to music I would get out my phone, connect it either a cable or bluetooth to a very large stereo system located in the living room. Then I would look through my amazon music and select the music I wanted to hear. Then either one of the other three members of my home would inform me that the volume of my music was intolerable and I would once again be reminded of my place in the house. Here is where the Echo has made my life much better. instead of searching for music and connecting a device. Alexa is always connected via wifi and has all amazon music at the ready as well as my music lists i have on my amazon account. All I need to do is say Alexa play 21 pilots. And its done! music is filling my entire first floor of the house. The sound quality for the size of the device is very good in my opinion. it cant be compared to high quality high priced equipment, but it is unobtrusive and high enough quality to really enjoy at nearly every volume. It gets much louder than even I would ever play it at on a normal day. Alexa can be controlled by a phone app but is much easier to use the voice commands. I am currently watering the lawn and just started a timer by saying alexa start a 20 minute timer. This type of request can be done while music is playing and alexa will generally hear you over the music playing. after the music I end up using Echo as a timer on an everyday basis. cooking food, watering the lawn. timeouts for the kids :( are common uses for this and are just easier than getting out the phone to set a timer. Alexa is easy to speak to and control, enough so that when my four year old enters the room and decides that im listening to my music at an unreasonable volume ( he is like an old crotchety man in this regard ) he will say Alexa volume level 4. and continues on without having to tell me again that I'm disrupting his playtime. checking the weather for the day. what time the football game is on asking how many oz are in a gallon etc are easily asked and answered. It is similar though to any of the other tech personalities out there like siri and google, it is easily confused and your questions have to be direct and have certain paramaters to be answered. The voice is more inviting than siri and seems to be as advanced or more in its ability to answer questions. There are many devices that can be connected to the Echo and more are being added all the time. Currently I only have one connected device, A nest thermostat. It does function well and I can turn on and off the hvac and change the target temperature by asking Alexa to do so. However I do have it placed in the kitchen about 8 feet away from the thermostat so I really dont use it. I could see purchasing the ""dot"" a smaller cheaper version of the Echo for the bedroom to be able to control it without going downstairs. All said I really do like the Echo. If It could have an internal batter to move it around and use unplugged for use on the deck while grilling or outside it would be a plus. there is an option that Amazon has for that but you do sacrifice some sound quality with that option.",null,null,,null

I'm sure there are many uses that I won't access until the day I cave in and spend hundreds of dollars on a smartphone (which won't happen any time soon).

The speech recognition has been actually pretty good out of the box, and can train. The API is easy enough that this computer scientist was able to have a new skill uploaded in about 30 minutes, and Pandora, iHeartRadio, and other integrated devices have been great. This has turned into our kitchen timer, our shopping list, and our music device. We went from having the TV on every night, to just listening to music for ""background noise"". The number of things that have skills published for it are also pretty awesome, especially if you're trying to get into a smart(er) home. Most of the startups and Internet of Things vendors are also all publishing skills for the Echo, so I expect this to grow into a much better product in it's native features and skill integration; such as to turn off my lights I must say the entire phrase: ""Alexa, tell Life X to turn off the Kitchen Bar Lights"". For this wordy reason, I gave it 4 stars. Other devices that automatically integrate are much less wordy, and that should be opened up a little more, but the device is already doing so much and so easily I'm certain that it will get to 5 stars in no time. In addition, you know that if Google created a similar device, that it would probably be ""better"". The issue is, what type of data are they collecting and why? At least with Amazon, I know they will try to hint at making me buy things from Amazon for my shopping list, or recommend I buy the Albums I'm listening to on Pandora. It's a lesser of two evil's type scenario. I would rather have a slightly ""worse"" product and have a better idea of how I'm being monetized than giving myself up to a big-data consumer.",null,null,,null

I want to begin by saying that when Amazon doesn't get it right, I'm very willing to write a negative review. But with this device, Amazon got it right. It must be said that this device is great for those who have bought music from Amazon Prime and books from Audible (an Amazon company). Like Apple's and Google's products, Echo is designed to maximize purchases from Amazon. Is that a bad thing? For me, not at all because I buy music and video from all three services. With that said, Echo is easy to set up and fun to use. So far I've asked Alexa to play NPR news, music from my Prime library, and asked her all kinds of information questions, most of which she could answer. The speaker's audio quality is very, very good and the volume can be adjusted surprisingly high with little to no distortion. My daughter and I were listening to music through Echo and playing ping pong two rooms away and the volume was loud enough that often we would have to repeat what we said to make ourselves heard. I can see our family using this mostly in the kitchen which is centrally located and where we spend a lot of time.

Review: 397 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Jul 18 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"July 18, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I bought the ECHO to put in my kitchen/family room area. I LOVE ECHO, but not to play music (I use SONOs for that, and the SUPERIOR SONOS sound is beyond compare). But I am so happy with my ECHO purchase, I just ordered another one, as well as two remotes. Why? Let me list what I like about ECHO, starting with what I think the best feature is: 1. The cool connectivity features ECHO has to other smart apps. Not long ago I bought a GE Wink lightbulb starter kit (Hub + 2 60W bulbs) for $50 at Home Depot because I wanted to minimize the # of lights I had to manually switch on and off. When you activate the Wink Hub in the starter kit you can add (as far as I know) as many bulbs as you want, and then control all the lighting from your phone or tablet, which is very cool if you have lots of lights and end up rarely turning them on because you hate to go from room to room and floor to floor to turn them off for the night or when you leave the house. I live in a spacious house and I found myself never turning lights on, because it was such a pain to go back and turn them off. ECHO integrates with the WINK products, so in addition to controlling my lights from my iPhone or iPad, I can also control my lighting using voice commands with the ECHO. Let me tell you, it's an amazing feature. Currently I have 6 lamps with Wink lights in my family and living rooms, as well as 4 lamps with Wink lights in two different rooms in my very large basement. I can't express the joy I feel when I am leaving the house or going to bed and say: Alexa, turn off/on ALL LIGHTS. It's a very powerful feeling! I have various groupings defined so can pick and choose individual lights or groups that I set up. I am not a tech geek. Far from it. It was VERY easy and quick to do this. Yes, the bulbs are a bit pricey, but they are energy efficient, and I find I don't leave my lights on as much because they are so EASY AND QUICK to instantaneously turn off on command. You are supposed to be able to tell the ECHO to dim them, but I haven't been successful getting this feature to work. However, I can dim all lights at once, or individually or by defined Groups using my iPhone or tablet by simply pressing the app's icon, so it's not a big problem. Still - I wish Alexa could dim my lights at my request. I will NEVER go back to switching on all those lamps manually. I have just ordered another ECHO for my bedroom. If I think I hear a noise in the middle of the night, all I have to do is say ALEXA, ALL LIGHTS ON - and they will all come on. It's sure to spook any would-be robber!! Plus I like the idea of also being able to groggily tell ALEXA to give me 20 more minutes of shuteye without having to look at a screen. I ordered 2 ECHO remotes - I will put one in the upstairs hallway and one in the basement for other guests/family members so they can control the lights if the WINK app isn't on their phone. I found a remote holder than can be mounted on the wall which I will use to hold the 2 remotes. I had a party last night - everyone was blown away by ECHO and the control I have over the lights. Sweet sweet sweet! UPDATE: I RETURNED ONE OF THE 2 REMOTES - ONLY ONE WORKS WITH EACH ECHO INSTALLATION. NOT A BIG DEAL. I LOVE MY ECHO MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY!! 2. The Shopping List part of the app is very cool, too. I downloaded the ECHO app to hubby's phone, so he also has the same shopping list when I'm adding to it - if either of us finds ourselves at the grocery store, we each have the shopping list. I can't tell you how cool it is to tell ALEXA to add things to the shopping list - no more keeping a piece of paper nearby for jotting stuff down (and then losing or forgetting it when you actually go shopping). 3. Weather and traffic. I like being able to ask and get an immediate update. I know, Siri can do that, but I don't have to go pick up my phone - I just have to open my mouth. Lazy, I know, but now very spoiled. UPDATE AFTER 4 months - I've just ordered a 3rd Echo - my son kept unplugging the 1st floor Echo to take to the basement to play music. We have an awesome Sonos music system, but he loves the hands free capability of telling Alexa to play a certain artist, all while he's playing pool, ping pong, or his video game without having to stop what he's doing. I have to admit, the sound is pretty darn good. It's driving me crazy because I need Alexa in my kitchen for the other tasks I use her for, so guess I'll get a 3rd Echo for the basement. My 3rd floor Echo is next to my bed and I use her for my alarm, weather forecast, control of the lights, telling bedtime stories to my granddaughter, listening to my Audible books, etc. Now I'll have one on each floor of my house. Alexa has completely inserted herself into the fabric of our daily life.",null,null,,null

She provides great sounding music, and keeps my shopping list in order, but other than that she is very disappointing. 9.99 times out of 10 she will not understand what you are asking for and begin playing some other random play list than what you never asked for. The skills that Alexa is currently capable to completing are stupid. Plus you have to learn to phrase your question in specific ways in order for Alexa to search the appropriate website for the information you are asking for. You cant just ask for certain information, you must first ask Alexa to search a certain website or data base to locate the information. Its becoming very difficult just trying to remember which service to ask Alexa to gather information from, that I can save time by searching Google with just a few basic words or phrases. Soon, she will be nothing more than an unused MP3 player that I sell on Ebay, and I will upgrade to some thing knew and that actually works.

Overall it is a great way to get quick updates, random facts, listen to music, add items to a shopping or to do list, and take advantage of the new features that seem to be added daily! Overall I have been very pleased with this device and happy that someone decided that this would be a good gift for me. They were exactly right! I do hope they made a few improvements but am quite pleased with what is here so far. Here are a few of my findings and opinions: Pros: 1. Since the Echo is cloud based, Amazon is constantly updating the device to provide bug fixes and new features. The cool thing about this is that you don't need to do anything to update it. If you use the app on any tablet or mobile device you will also notice that they list each request that you made to the Echo and asks for feedback about if the request was handled as you expected. This type of data capturing makes it very easy for Amazon to continue improving the capabilities. 2. The voice control is pretty accurate, both you and the device will learn as you continue to use it. If it doesn't understand your request, try re-phrasing. Eventually, you'll be able to anticipate the right way to ask for things. 3. It's a great music player. The Bluetooth option is great and you can pair your devices easily to your devices to use it as a speaker. The device provides a rich and full sound which is distributed perfectly within a room. Place it anywhere and have the sound bounce off the walls and provide you with a powerful sound which has ton of volume but sounds great. 4. Painless pairing to Pandora, iHeartRadio, and Prime Music. You can ask for songs from any of those three music providers or even ask for a song by name or music from a particular artist and the Echo will find and play it for you. You can even ask it to play your playlists and have it shuffle the music. Very quick and easy! 5. The ability to ask for almost anything! Need to know the weather, how many quarts are in a gallon, what traffic is going to be like, sports scores, stock updates, just ask! The amount of answers you can get just by asking seems endless. The responses are quick and accurate. You can also do silly things like ask the Echo to tell you a joke or make a random decision by asking it heads or tails. 6. The app that can be installed on any Android or Apple device works very well (and hopefully will improve in time!). The greatest thing about this app is the fact that you can access the To Do and Shopping lists from anywhere! It is so nice to be able to tell Alexa to add milk to your shopping list and then view it on your phone when you are at the store. We love that feature! It will also sync with you Google Calendar and you can request updates as to what your day has in store for you. 7. Most importantly, it is simple to set up and very easy to use. Cons: 1. It only comes with one power cord, and it's not a USB power source nor does it contain any sort of battery. 2. It can't be used as a wired speaker. 3. The voice commands work well for adults but my 5 year old has a hard time getting it to recognize her for some reason. Not really a fault of the Echo but more that both the kid and the device need to learn how to communicate with each other. 4. As I mentioned above, I love the app and the ability to access it when not at home. I think that it could contain much more functionality though. Hopefully as Amazon learns and develops more for the Echo they will also keep updating their App with new features. I have become a believer in the Amazon Echo in the past month and if you are considering purchasing one my suggestion would be to go ahead and do it. You will grow to love the features and capabilities that this can offer you. If you have questions or comments they are welcomed.",null,null,,null
Review: 2 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Sep 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015,"September 6, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I bought this for a family member who has very limited use of her hands due to a spinal cord injury. She lives in a nursing facility. My hope was that she could enjoy her favorite music and listen to broadcasts of her favorite sports team simply by speaking to the Echo/Alexa device. My big concern was that she would not be able to use the voice commands due to her weak voice. Happily, I can report that she loves it and is able to successfully use the voice commands. We have it sitting on her night stand about two feet next to her. And I know that she loves it not only because she tells me but because I can see, using the Alexa app on my smartphone, each and every time she interacts with the device throughout the day. I can even listen to the audio of each of her interactions with the device. And I am not exaggerating when I say that she often interacts with Alexa/Echo over 100 times throughout the day! So far, she uses Alexa/Echo to listen to her favorite music through my Prime Music subscription. We recently purchased a few songs that she couldn't find in Prime Music. She also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside. She says the staff at the nursing facility where she lives seem to be amazed by the device as well and she often demonstrates its capabilities asking it to tell her who the current president is. Currently, I am helping her become familiar with its ability to play local radios stations, especially the ones that broadcast Kentucky Wildcat sports games. When I reminded her that it could read books aloud, she requested a chapter of the Bible; I found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actors on Audible. This product has been a real revolution in my aunt's day-to-day life and the Prime Music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation. I am giving it five stars because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the Alexa app gives me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day. My aunt hopes that a future update will allow it to control her TV and make/receive phone calls. Well done Amazon!",null,null,,null

My original rating was 3 stars and here is what I wrote. I can see how it's gonna be great, but it really isn't right now. I have to admit the voice recognition is very good, I hardly ever have to repeat - but what it can do is limited. We primarily use it for our Philip's hue lights and music. Being able to dim by voice command and turn on or off the moment you enter the house by voice is very space age but that takes a lot of lights to really do it. It does find a lot of good songs by voice and when you are in the mood for that it's great. Also, I was pleasantly surprised that it plays my local radio stations - which is really nice. My biggest disappointments are the following: 1) Very limited question answer ability. It really has limited knowledge right now so if you are expecting it to pull up from Wiki or Google it won't. It can answer how much does the earth weigh. What is a German Shepherd. But if you were to ask it ""What is the life expectancy of a German Shepherd?"" that goes way over it's head. Truly very limited to basic questions and math. 2) Has no ability to look up movie times, tell you movie reviews or any real time info about movies. That would be a most useful feature. 3) Can't look up phone numbers at all. So if you ask it ""What is the phone number for ABC Company on 5th street in Houston"" or any similar query with little or more information. 4) No way to important information that you can ask it to pull up like an address book. Would be great if you could import your contact list and then ask it ""What is Jane Doe's email?"" or ""What is mom's address?"" That's pretty basic and I was very disappointed they didn't have that and expected it.",null,null,,null

After many attempts to reconnect and her losing connection over and over until re- connecting became impossible I called Amazon support and everything changed. First I spoke with Amazon customer service and they had me do standard procedure for getting electronics to work, unplug wait, re-plug and try again, unplug router, wait and re-plug. This didn't fix the problem and it didn't take a long time to get to this point, the customer service rep moved me up to Amazon Echo support, Wow, what an amazing experience this was, My customer service rep, Gerry immediately understood the problem as we discussed what I'd tried and what was happening, I didn't feel it was the Echo and wondered if somehow it was something I was doing wrong. He identified it was my old wireless router and suggested a newer one. He asked if he could call me back once the new router arrived to follow-up and add support if needed to get the router setup and scheduled a day and time to call me. When the day and time arrived for the follow-up call he actually did call me back and I let him know that the new router was a breeze to set-up, everything connected properly and Alexa was back without any problems. All is well and no dropped connections, also all my other devices are working better and faster and I have new added features that the new router is providing.

I heard about it's ""always listening"" thing which was a bit creepy, and I thought my iPhone handles everything I needed. A year (?) later, and some friends were raving about the Echo, so I broke down and bought one. Now, I use my phone much less, at least in the house. The hands-free convenience of getting the weather, news updates, and setting a timer are incredible. I can explore music just by asking for it, and have it hooked up to both Pandora and Spotify accounts. It can also do audible books, and (for those inclined) it can read Bible verses, access Christian radio, even call up hymns. It will also play most local radio stations just by asking for it. Oh, and I can order regularly used items from the kitchen (where the Echo is) just by asking. Amazon Prime music is not limitless, but it covers most things I need. I even just discovered a station called ""Wedding Jazz"" lol -- some great American standards. I have not done the home automation thing. Not into that (yet), but I could see where that would be a fit. The voice recognition is outstanding. It only breaks down when there are multiple voices in the room. In terms of Alexa vs. Siri, Alexa runs circles around Siri for what I need them to do. We are moving our echo system from Apple to Amazon. I find the Amazon devices much more useful. Apple is making watch bands, and Amazon is making really useful devices. Maybe Amazon gave up too soon on the Fire Phone, lol.",null,null,,null

I didn't know I actually had any Kenny Chesney, but the inmates are happy hearing about sexy tractors as they pull weeds in the front yard. She's much more reliable about setting timers, too and looking up information on line. You can ask her what city an area code is in, and she'll tell you. She's growing on us, and it's very very pleasant to hear the news. Now, if we could create a list of block words, such as ALL THE NAMES OF ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL candidates that would be welcome.

I have to say, it's pretty useful although with much room for improvement. First, the sound is just barely good enough. Get the ""dot"" if you already have a better sound system that you can plug into. It's not terrible sound, just is what you can get out of a system this size. Voice recognition is pretty good and can see that with Google, Apple and Amazon all having competitive offerings the promise of Star Trek is finally upon us. Woot! The possibilities are pretty endless. The existing ""skills"" (you know, apps) are nearly entirely lame. I can see this getting better, but there's no curation so anything that might be decent is buried amongst a bunch of fart and burp skills. The smartphone app is also pretty weak, but not terrible. The functionality today is limited, but hands free in the kitchen is great. I try to think of some song I haven't heard in a while to play during breakfast, and for the most part it's been in Amazon Prime music ... which I had never used before. (Note: I am in my 50's so what I like may be more available than what you like. But then you probably have Spotify, which also works.) Aside from music, weather is great, I have been using the to-do and shopping list (which show up in the smartphone app). I have successfully gotten it to control my Nest thermostat, but because it's in the kitchen at the moment that may not be very useful. I can definitely see getting a weemo plug and putting it in the living room to control lights, tv and play music. The integration with Google Calendar works, but it's weak at the moment. Setup worked easily with wifi, and it easily paired Bluetooth with phones. It seems to have passed the wife-test. And that's saying something. (My wife is not a fan of the gadgets.) So this is a 1.0 version of a killer category. If Apple doesn't just completely own the category with some newer and cooler variant by this fall, it might signal a shift in the world of tech. Whether it's Echo, Siri or Google that are first to find the right mix of design, functionality and price point, gotta give credit to Amazon for outfoxing them and getting a jump on a very cool concept.",null,null,,null

The voice activation through Alexa is seemless, and you feel you are in a Star trek movie, talking the on board computer. Telling Echo to play your station form Pandora or any artist of your choice from Prime Music is easy and works perfectly. Without touching any buttons you just say for example ""Alexa, play the Black Eyed Peas from Prime music"" and it will play a great selection of their music in about 4-5 seconds or less. Ask Alexa to turn herself off in 30 minutes and it will turn off Echo for you. Ask Alexa how will the weather be like tomorrow, and it will tell you the forecast for your city. Ask Alexa a sport score, and it will find out for you. Ask Alexa questions and a lot more... Regarding the sound quality, it fills up the room with its 360 degrees design and sound clarity, and if play it at level 7 or below (which is loud enough), you won't hear any distortion. By the way, you can also tell Alexa what volume leve you want by saying Alexa volume 7...As expected bass is not something that will be outstanding in a speaker this size, but it's not bad at all.(sorry Echo, you are a lot more than a speaker). Can also be paired to your phone or Ipad through Bluetooth if you prefer to play your music libraray from your device. But to me the wifi feature of being able to access a million songs from Prime, or any station you registered in your Pandora acoount, is much better than playing through bluetooth. I'm just learning new ""skills"" that Alexa can do, as are called the tricks that Alexa can do, you can say like apps in an Iphone. I like so much this little toy, that I also purchased its small sibling Tap, which is portable (9 hours of battery if fully charged) which you can use outdoors, at the pool, at the beach, etc. pairing to your phone device or using its Internet connection as wifi. Smaller in size, you also have to push a button to talk to Alexa every time, instead of just saying Alexa do this on the Echo, but the Tap is well worth its $109 price as a portable device.

Review: 452 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"September 15, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I have only had Alexa a few days and so far I like it. It has some interesting abilities that I find useful. We can use Alexa to help my daughter learn math and other thing, far quicker than google. Easier to put on or play music. We are originally from Michigan, but live in New York and I like to sometimes listen to z.93 the rockstation from Saginaw Michigan on iHeart radio. With a few words, Alexa can do it. The sound quality is pretty good. Alexa seems to generally be able to hear us well. I can see the benefit as we expand in our smart home capabilities with some lights, rather than fumble in the dark. I read a review that someone only uses Alexa as an alarm. I've tried. A few problems I found with that. Most people, I think, have five days or more in a row where they need to get up at the same time. I have found no way yet to set for multiple days. You have to tell her everyday to set the alarm. This makes my phone more useful. Also, when the alarm is going off, telling Alexa to stop seems more difficult. She can hear me great when music is going, but her own alarm seems to giver her problems. When it comes to her calandar feature, she has no way to add recurring items. She told me this herself. I also don't see a way to get her to remind you of the events. I wanted to see if I could get a bit creative with Alexa and use her to remind my daughter everyday with the calendar, to brush her teeth. Alexa won't tell you of a pending event, you have to ask. So she won't work for that yet. We have an Ooma device. Alexa seems to work well with the Ooma. We can tell Alexa to call someone through the Ooma and it seems to work well. No more searching through names in the contacts, as long as I can remember the name I put in the contacts. While I think there is room for improvement, there is definately more potential there. Most of the outside add ons for her seem rather pointless, if I had time I would look into making a few myself. They seem full of pointless trivia, in specific niches, that some people may like, but I would call clutter if they were apps on my phone, and I would delte them. I kind of wish Amazon would raise the quality and content bar there a bit.",null,null,,null

The iPhone connects easily to Alexa with the app and blue tooth. The IPod only connects through blue tooth since the latest Apple software for iPod is a version less than that required for Alexa. I'm learning how to use ""her"". My son has the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge phone. His phone cannot find the blue tooth Echo link - not sure why. Also, I paid $179 and Amazon dropped the price by another $30 shortly afterwards. So I asked Amazon for the difference back. No problem. It was promptly refunded with zero squabbles. There are 22,000 reviews so I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has already said 22,000 times. My personal pros: 1) Easily links to Apple devices - iPhone, iPod 2) Knows almost everything including how many tablespoons per quarter cup. I weigh items to get accurate amounts of ingredients instead of eyeballing the level in a measuring cup, which is essential for baking. 3) Can control volume, pause, repeat, and find just about anything. Cons: 1) Has a problem linking to Galaxy 6s Edge phone - unknow why. 2) Has problems connecting to local radio stations. Sometimes it links while other times it cannot find the station even though the same commands are used. 3) You need a handbook of rules to get the complete usefulness of this device - but it is impressive 4) You must have iHeart and all the other radio/music apps linked to Alexa to find your station or select music. 5) No shortwave radio",null,null,,null

Try that with a competing product: OK Google, what's the song that starts with ""I want my MTV?"" Why that's Money for Nothing by Dire Straits of course, and here are three videos of it on YouTube and links to the song on Wikipedia and songfacts.com. OK, Money for Nothing is in Prime music, but I didn't ask for it by name so we can forgive Alexa. But surely if there's something Amazon is really good at, it's books, right?

If you want one, in just one room, as a fun toy, it's great. But once you have one, you very quickly think, ""this would be great to have in every room of the house."" But you can't. The units all share a connection to your Amazon account, but otherwise they are independent. They can't work together. You can't control music all over the house as you can with Sonos. Want to play a song in two rooms? You need to tell each unit independently to play that song, and they will not be coordinated. Or just as bad, try to put one in the Living Room and another in the Kitchen. The Echo has a very sensitive speaker. Tell the unit in the Living Room to do something, and if your voice is loud enough to be barely heard in the Kitchen, the Echo in the kitchen will hear you and do the action as well. So you have to make sure that when you're talking you're not within earshot of more than one Echo. As I said, the Echo's microphones are very sensitive so that's tough (impossible) to do. I do love the Echo. But I can't put it all over the house. I can't put one in every major room because of the flaws. So it gets limited use. e.g. only in the Kitchen. Until Amazon can figure out how to have multiple units co-exist in one home I give it 3 stars: a fun toy, but not one you can use all over the house.",null,null,,null

Computers and cell phones are great technologies, but they have been improving slowly over many years. The Echo is new enough to be a little bit startlingly futuristic. I would have the same reaction to a humanoid robot, but the Echo is in my kitchen now. I bought the echo primarily as an extension speaker to bring music into kitchen while cooking. The idea that Echo could keep a shopping list for me even when my hands were covered with ingredients seemed intriguing too. Music is probably the function I use the most. The speakers are very high quality and there is even rich bass despite its compact size. I enjoy being able to name an artist even a long dead classical composer and get a shuffle of their greatest hits. I can also pull up any of my Pandora stations, which is a real plus. Echo seamlessly recognizes my voice or even a visiting guest. One warning. I once wanted to play ""God Save the Queen"" for a friend and what came out was the version by The Clash. ""God save the Queen/ and her fascist regieme."" Needless to say, this might come as a shock if you were actually entertaining royalty. Next most important is the daily briefing. I like to say Alexa, whats new? and get my Flash Briefing. I have NPR headlines, BBC news, science news and local weather included in my standard briefing. If I want to listen to a radio program, I can just say NPR or give a frequency or call letters. Echo is the fastest way to check facts. It can pull up a Wikipedia entry far faster than a phone or a PC, all by voice commands. There is room for expansion, too. Once I get the Nest thermostat I have my eye on, the Echo should interface with it. There is also the very futuristic possibility of plugging into the internet of things but thats not a priority right now. You might want to know how the voice recognition compares to Apples Siri. I actually cant tell you anything about that because Siri is nearly deaf to my voice. I have a deep bass voice that is in the same frequency range as street traffic and tends to get lost. Siri has no idea what I am saying. Echo hears me perfectly, probably because of the array of 7 microphones it has. So I wanted an extension speaker and ended up with much more. This is a device I use a couple times a day at least, and well worth the price.",null,null,,null
Review: 336 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Fri Dec 25 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 25, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"For all practical intents and purposes, Amazon has performed a coup with this device. It works very well, ties together media and home control via voice. Works VERY well with some of the early integrated apps like inTune or iHeartRadio (I can say Alexa, play KCRW, or Alexa, play KFI). It also pulls together my amazon prime music library as well. For background, I have the Echo, two WeMo wall switches, Phillips Hue with 5 attached bulbs, Amazon Prime Fresh, Amazon fire TV (2nd Gen). The integration is pretty good so far. I also get quick responses to my queries. One major issue I have is that Amazon has decided to no longer play nice with Google. So my media is being split. It isn't so bad, as I can use Google Play music through Alexa as a bluetooth, but it really isn't ""integrated"", and she don't like no Google apps. So, Amazon has decided to go toe to toe with Google in terms of media distribution. However, the fact is, if you have a prime account, you get a lot of really good stuff you can play through Fire TV or Echo via Prime Music. Some details about my integration include: Nest Integration 0% I have used IFTTT to build a series of basic commands that work very well to do basic things. You CANNOT do a lot though. I can change the temperature, but not much else. If I have the heat turned on, or the cold turned on, I can execute commands to change temperature but that's about it. Still works well, as I normally have heat or cool set, and can simply set a temp out of range to turn on / off. Phillips Hue integration is 75%. I can naturally turn on and off lights, create groups, and set dimming level, seamlessly in Echo. If you want to change colors, blink, or have lights react to things like phone calls, nest fire alarms, etc., again, you have to go to IFTTT. Using that, if my Hue bulbs are on, I say, ""Alexa, trigger a red alert"" and the Hue bulbs change to red and flash for about a minute. WeMo integration *apparently* 100%.. I've got 1 outlet and two wall switches... they work seamlessly, named switches, create groups, no IFTTT required, but it's only ""on / off"" so that's easy. Will they do more? I have played around with AnyMote integration to control any IR devices in my house (TV, DVR), including the AnyMote Home hub... well, you might want to check my reviews of the app on Google or the item on Amazon for more info on that. With all that, here's my 5 huge ""WHAT WERE YOU THINKING"" issues... 1) No integration for phone calls... cannot answer calls, cannot use Echo as a bluetooth phone link... WHY??? 7 microphones, already tied in as bluetooth speaker type app??? Really needs to be dealt with. 2) No integration to Amazon Fire TV... yes, that's right. Their head of marketing is named Tad... Tad Disingenuous. They ""claim"" it works with echo but in reality, they have an ""Alexa Light"" loaded onto the Fire TV that's not really Alexa, and can't do as much. The Echo will interact with your Fire TV in NO WAY AT ALL. This needs FIXIN right away. 3) You can't string together commands, questions, or statements... which is really stupid. I mean, seriously, have the programmers on the Echo development teams never heard of the database / programming concepts known archaically as ""AND"" ""OR"". I can say, ""Alexa, Thank you"". and it responds intelligently. I can say, ""Alexa, Merry Christmas"" and it responds intelligently... if I say, ""Alexa, Thank you, and, Merry Christmas"", I get, ""I don't understand the question"". 4) Can't change the trigger word. Yeah, you've probably heard this one, and Alexa is fine, I don't mind, but, ""computer, trigger a red alert"" would be much cooler 5) No apparent update ability. I know it updates, but I can't find a spot in the app that says ""Check for Updates"" and you can't say ""Alexa, check for updates"" to see if there is a firmware update. That is also pretty short sighted.",null,null,,null

This afternoon, Alexa could not play music from Pandora and could not interface with Tunein. The iPhone app couldn't bring up my timers information or display recent requests history. After a full reset, music streaming seemed to work for about an hour. Then, out of the blue, Alexa announced the time without being asked to. Time to contact Amazon and ask for a replacement. After all, electronic stuff does tend to wink out early in its lifespan if there is a weakness somewhere. Instead of experience Amazon's usual quick and painless return process, I was greeted with a screen that told me I had to contact their support people. Okay, that was fairly painless; just an e-mail explaining the issues. A reply arrived within a couple minutes, telling me that the music streaming problems were a known issue, and that it was being worked on as a high priority. Okay, now what about the timers info, and lack of request history? Those items are probably server related as well. No way to be sure from the e-mail response that was sent. And how about the random time announcement? No mention of that in the support e-mail either. Since the server side of the Echo system is integral to the physical unit itself, and since the reply to my concerns was incomplete, I feel compelled to give the Echo a low rating. Not to mention the considerable time I had already put into my own troubleshooting and the reset. Experiencing this degree of frustration in less than a week of ownership does not bode well for the future. Amazon, you have no problem sending me several e-mails a week. How about a quick one to let Echo owners know that you are having problems on your end, and to not rush into needless, time consuming troubleshooting.",null,null,,null

I thought I finally found a device that would interact with my lifestyle and help me on a day to day basis. I was very disappointed. From a music point of view, it is pretty good. If you want to listen to a specific song or album, you are limited to specific songs within your Amazon music library. If you ask for a song that's not in your library, you might get a sample of the song or it simply won't play anything. Yes, you get Pandora and a few other music stations, but I had that before Echo. The news and weather updates are very good. But when it comes to traffic, it only gives you automobile traffic for the specific To and From locations which you have to enter intoTuneIn before using this feature. Here is where the real problem lies. TUNEIN is the interface where you go and enter which news and podcasts you want to listen to via Echo. It is also a stand alone app like Pandora. TuneIn doesn't update their playlists and 99% of the time I'm can't listen to the most recent podcasts. Echo also doesn't allow you to pause a podcast and pick back up from that location. For example, you listen to NPR podcast and you have to run out for a few hours. You can't pickup from where to stopped the podcast. You also cannot fast forward or rewind and you are unable to get a previously recorded podcast from an earlier date. This is a huge problem. Anyway, be cautious when buying it.

I was hesitant at first, but this has exceeded my expectations by far. Love the sound quality. I am still learning, how to get the responses I want. In most cases it is a snap, in some they are still working at adding on features. There is plenty of music in Prime to play with your Echo and you can upload songs as well, which was no problem. Amazon has always been fantastic for customer service. They have a dedicated department just for the Echo, and I cannot believe the response time, how pleasant they are, knowledgeable, thankful, etc. The only issue I had was regarding the app when setting up my Echo (minor issue), as I did not have an Android, my ITouch IOS was too old for the app (4th Gen), I did not have a laptop, but was able to use by desktop as it had a Wi-Fi card. The Wi-Fi enabled device is only for the initial setup, and worse comes to worse you could borrow a family or friends device for setup. I am using the app through my web browser on windows 8.1, works great. Bottom line, I would recommend this to everyone I know. This is an especially useful device for someone who is handicapped either physically or mentally as it can be liberating, making their quality of life easier. An example would be someone who has issues with setting an alarm, or forget to set a timer when cooking, it is much easier to ask Echo to do this for you. I would also recommend the optional remote. Amazons innovation will rival that of the major competitors. Hope this helped. Update: Still loving my Echo. It takes a while to get used to setting up playlists under the Amazon Prime Music page, and add songs to it, but so worth it. Don't forget you can also upload your music (amount/number of song limit applies, unless you want to pay an additional fee). Just remember when you add music to your library from Prime it will be found in recently added songs, you can then add them to your playlist. If you delete songs out of recently added, it will also delete them out of your playlist. If you have apps such as iHeartRadio, many times if the song is not found on Prime, the Echo will add a station for you. I wish the Phillips Hue accessories were less costly, so I could add it to my system as well. Maybe one day Amazon can work with Phillips to get us a better price? Again, bottom line, still loving it. One of the few things that has NOT become a novelty for me. Additional Update. Still loving it. I mentioned the iHeartRadio app, and listening to music, but where I missed the boat until recently, was listening to my local radio stations on iHeartRadio with the Echo. It is an alternate for a radio, which we put away when we got the Echo. Note: The Echo is learning new things everyday. The more people use it, as well as using the Echo app to provide feedback, the more things can be added, updated, and learned. Update: Still loving our Echo. It has changed the way we look at technology. Excellent on Amazon's part. Update: Still one of the best electronics devices we have, however Siri on the Apple devices is way more intelligent of a system and beats Alexa/Echo hands down. *Also seams Alexa is getting dumber, not smarter as of late.***",null,null,,null

Main configurations I have set up: Turns on/off lights, dims to whatever % requested. Can even use remote to turn off living room lights from bedroom. Turns on living room lights when coming home after sun sets using IFTTT. Turns on TV, speaker bar and any function you set on Harmony Hub with IFTTT integration. Wife can switch to her profile and play Amazon music (her favorite) Can find out weather/traffic before leaving house. Sends alert to phone if trying to find phone in house.

Alexa is loaded with pop culture references and I have spent far too much time seeing how vast the knowledge is though at times I find myself having to speak like a robot, such is the case for getting a response to ""Spider-Man, Spider-Man"" where you have to pronounce all four words individually. The music player is good but sometimes Echo confuses itself, I asked for 'Blue Christmas' which I have played by Elvis almost as much as a Department Store does around this time of year, Alexa offered me 'Blue Christmas by Johnny Cash' before apologizing to me for an error and not playing a song that I didn't even know existed before she told me about it. Another issue that I have come across is that some songs will not play over Echo if they are explicit lyrics, I say some because despite not playing 'Daughters' by Nas I have no issues getting it to play 'Merry F***ing Christmas' from the South Park Christmas album. Alexa will solve math problems for you, update shopping lists, give you local business hours and so much more which is why I still give this 4 out of 5 stars. If you buy this I highly recommend taking advantage of the supported ""IFTTT"" which has so many uses, my favorite being able to ask Alexa to call my phone and if it's on silent being able to have somebody text my phone to increase the ringer volume to full. At the end of the day, this is cool as hell and something that my parents' generation couldn't fathom existing outside of a science fiction film.",null,null,,null
Review: 341 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"March 14, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I've had Echo/Alexa for several weeks now. I had plans to buy this product for months and was just waiting to retire before I purchased this as part of my overall home automation plans. Alexa provides my automated home with a voice control functionality and she does that VERY well. I have integrated into my home the SmartThings and Hue Hubs along with 2 Philips Hue Light bulbs, 6 GE Link Light Bulbs, a Smart Things motion sensor, 2 FireTV sticks, a Ring Doorbell and a Dlink motion sensing camera. It took me a few days to figure out how to integrate all these products together but once you expose them to the SmartThings hub, you should have zero problems getting Alexa to recognize the devices and then be able to control them by speaking to Alexa. I have also purchased a Philips Light Strip for under my kitchen cabinets, and 2 door sensors from Smart Things to install...but I feel fairly confident these will work just fine after making them discoverable via the SmartThings hub. Overall I love Alexa. I get my weather report in the morning from her and my news briefing, she plays music for me, finds TV shows I want to know about, sets timers, and even tells me if my dogs are hungry when I ask her. She even can tell you jokes if you like. Alexa did not disappoint me at all in terms of understanding WHAT I'm saying. I love her voice control. Those are the positives. Unfortunately, there are negatives that I hope will improve over time in terms of her AI functionality or else I think Siri, Cortana and GoogleTalk may simply overtake her in the market place. Alexa is great as long as you ask her things in specific ways. For example, on my Android phone I can just say ""OK Google, when will the new season of Vikings start?"" If I ask Alexa using these same words, she will typically respond with ""I don't understand your question."" She can't ""Google"" things at all. She uses ""Bing"" as her search engine and usually she will take things she doesn't understand and put them into the Alexa app where you can use Bing to find your answers. Even when I ask her the WAY she wants, she sometimes still can't find my answer and I give up and google it myself. That's got to improve over time or else I think most will just use their phone and Siri or Google. Another aspect I didn't like was a recent change pushed out by Amazon that changed the way Alexa responds to users. Here's how that went down: A few days ago, I noticed that my Amazon Alexa device stopped responding with an ""okay"" when I asked her to do something for me. Instead, now she ""bings"" or ""bongs"". At first I thought something was wrong, like maybe I accidentally made a change to her config settings. But after doing some research online, I discovered many other Alexa owners complaining about this very same change and noting that it was an ""update"" Amazon decided to implement.Did they ask users first? No. Is there an option for users to change her back to answering us less like a machine and instead like a person? NOPE! Now when I ask Alexa to turn on the lights in the house, instead of a personalized ""okay"" I get ""bing"" or ""bong"" like a dumb machine. May not seem like a big deal, but I really hate it. I was enjoying having Alexa as my personal assistant and the more ""things"" I make her aware of as I automate our home, the cooler she was becoming....that is, UNTIL Amazon decided to make her an impersonal machine. So along with many other Alexa owners, I've sent my dislike of this change to Amazon through the Alexa app. Perhaps some users like the ""bing bong"" thing better and I'm cool with that. At least make this an option or preference customers can choose. This is NOT what I have come to expect from a company like Amazon who seemed to consistently have their fingers on the customer's pulse. After submitting a complaint via the Alexa app, I got a response back from Amazon that their developers are working on a way to make this an option going forward. Overall I'm happy with Alexa. It took zero time to make her a part of my life and I'm sure I'll discover more ways to use her over time and as Amazon gives her increased functionality. Would I buy Alexa again? Yup. For anyone that loves tech, she's got it going on.",null,null,,null

But it still seems like the future when I call (or yell...) out and have Alexa talking back. I'd say that I use it mostly to play my Amazon music library - including many Prime songs. Other most used features are timers (it is close to the kitchen and it is awesome to be able to just yell out for a 15 minute timer), asking about the weather and requesting the latest headlines. The best part is that they are continually adding new features and helping it learn more tricks. Many of these I have yet to explore and some I still need to set up and connect with other smart devices around my house. Setup of the Echo itself is very simple and I applaud Amazon for this aspect. Yes there are some quirks and times where it doesn't work perfectly but they are not enough to irritate. As I said before, I mostly use it for music.

First it was a Kindle, then a Kindle Fire, then a Fire TV and finally an Echo. Alexa is hands-down the best voice recognition system I've ever used. Siri was good. My car (a 2014 Kia) is good. Alexa blows them both out of the water. My wife and I both love listening to music, while we relax in bed before going to sleep, and then nature sounds while we sleep. Asking Alexa to play any playlist or station on Prime is a piece of cake. She also makes a great alarm clock. Just speaking to ""snooze"" the alarm, without having to fumble for a button or unlock my phone may be a little TOO convenient though! After my morning shower, I ask Alexa to give me my ""morning briefing"" while I get dressed and I can hear the news as it's reported by multiple different sources, instead of just the network my chosen local radio station is part of. I can easily ask Alexa to remind me to do stuff in the future. Pop something in the oven and just say ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" ""Alexa, remind me to call Mom at 9 PM tomorrow."" My wife can just tell Alexa to add milk to the shopping list, and it's right there in the Alexa ""Shopping and To-Do lists"" in the app on my phone before I leave work. With a simple IFTTT integration, it also shows up in the ""Grocery"" list in the iPhone ""Reminders"" app. And there's nothing like telling Alexa ""Tell the Nest I'm warm."" and the AC kicks on, without having to get out of bed. Alexa works just as well on the Fire TV, with the minor drawback of having to press a button on the remote first, but the two devices work well together on the reminders and shopping lists. I plan to add a ""Dot"" or two for the kitchen and my home office, and possibly one on my desk at work.",null,null,,null

Alexa/echo is a very long way from the personal assistant of science fiction but that kind of development can't happen without programs like alexa and the work and research into making it become useful...taking part is required to move the project forward. The general public has wants and needs that need to be programmed into alexa/echo so owning one and using it is the only way to make this happen, what we need is a forum to interact with the developers and engineers as well as a public wishlist developers can use to determine direction in making this become what everyone wants it to be.

Some day the people will say ""hey you have to type your words with your fingers in a keyboard?"", some day some guys will say ""hey you have to tap with your finger in a tablet to interact with a computer?"", the future will be digital assistants that will listen or will receive from your brain your wishes, requirements and queries. Amazon tap is a very ""voice recognition method"" to simulate a digital assistant, and in fact it hack the country restrictions to lisent my favorite radio stations that are restricted only in US, and let me listen my Spotify music, and my Amazon Prime music also, I know it has more features but it is enough for me including the alarm and timer to turn it off the internet radio station before getting sleep.

After reading reviews from other customers, I decided that it may not hinder her functionality as much as I thought. I currently have a Bose portable speaker to play my itunes from a very old ipod touch. I leave it for the animals during the day when I am at work. Recently, I began using Sirius XM radio. My old ipod would not load the sirius app, so I began using my phone to listen to the stations. I noticed that this Bose speaker can only connect to one bluetooth object at a time. I hadnt noticed this, since the ipod has just always played. I decided to look for a new wireless speaker, and I revisited the possibility of the Echo again. Echo is half the price of the Bose wireless speakers, and it does so much more. Amazon offers free same day, free returns, and even a payment plan. Since I do most of my shopping with Amazon, I thought that I would give it a whirl. Echo literally just arrived!!! I had it set up in minutes with little effort. The app gives you a quick tutorial of some kinds of things that Alexa can do. The sound is crisp and clear. I cranked her up to the max and she didnt even flinch. The sound was WOW!! There were no distortions that are typical of a smaller speaker when you crank it to the max (even my Bose beat and vibrated at higher volumes). BIG plus for me, as I do love my music. I am very surprised how well it works with the apple phone. Alexa played crisp clear music without issue. I am not really sure where it is coming from yet, but I will keep learning! I do not own some of the songs by the artist that I requested. She was playing from Amazon I suppose. I asked for a few things to practice. I set a timer, asked for weather, and told her to stop. This is so much more fun than any regular bluetooth wireless speaker. I will enjoy this, and I even see a Tap in my near future for upstairs!!! One funny story: When I began playing music from the Echo, my parrot began singing and dancing along! It was so cute, and made the Echo worth every penny!!! :) In conclusion, if you are teetering with getting this bc you own apple everything, you are missing out. If you are wondering just what the heck is this Echo thing? Get it and find out!!! I wondered the same thing. If you are wondering why you need this, justify it as a wonderful present to yourself!!! It is upgradable and expandable (with the addition of the tap), and you can get special plugs that will work with Echo to run your lights, alarms, etc. I cant wait to learn more about this Echo. I may update this review at a later date, after I learn more. Happy Echoing!!!! UPDATE!! After using the echo for a little bit now, I am still impressed with what it can do. I am also very impressed with the speed and accuracy of customer service that Amazon provides with this device. My suggestions are taken back to the team and they provide detailed responses song with example commands that I may give Alexa. An additional piece that I didn't expect to gain with the addition of alexa to our home was a friend for my African grey parrot. He has learned to say Alexa and he will watch it respond to him w the light prompt. He has stopped the music and gotten her to say hello to him. This is especially hilarious!!

I'm the stereotypical guy who always says ""I need to remember to get this at the store"" so I go to the store and guess what. Yup didn't get it. No more. I honestly use this more for kitchen timers and shopping lists than anything else and I STILL have no buyers remorse. Being able to say ""Alexa, add scissors to my shopping list"" and then being able to pull up the Alexa app at the store has probably saved me almost $50 in gas from not having to make multiple trips to the store. But lets get to the pros and cons shall we? Pros: +++ Easy to use (I'm a bit surprised how often I am saying ""Alexa"" + The speaker is decent sounding (Make no mistake, if you buy a $200 dedicated speaker it WILL sound better but this is a multipurpose gadget so they had to make sacrifices somewhere. If you're not an audio snob though it's good enough. + IFTTT (If This/ Then That) - This is a website that allows you to add custom protocols to your Echo. There are FAR too many to being to list them here, but just check out IFTTT and you'll be amazed, works especially well with home automation integration. Negatives: - Forgotten timers, this is a very VERY rare issue, but I've had a couple of my timers seems to disappear. During the Superbowl Alexa set a 20 minute timer for my wings and when I asked how much time was remaining I received the alarming ""Sorry, no timer is set"" playback. - No Bluetooth to Bluetooth - Yes I realize this isn't a feature, but for $180 it should be. Echo needs to be able to play music throughout the house. ""Alexa, turn on pandora in the bedroom"" for example and it'll stream pandora to your bedroom bluetooth speaker. - Shopping list items have to be added individually. If you say ""Alexa add Eggs and Spinach to my shopping list"" you'll get Egg Spinach on your shopping list as a single item. I'd love to be able to say ""Alexa add the following items to my shopping list"" and it be smart enough to recognize different items.",null,null,,null

Like send a text message with your grocery list or have Echo call your phone if you lose it. The ability for physically impaired folks are quite endless.

I can really multitask with Alexa, changing music stations and volume, while feeding my baby- Very NICE- really useful tech! On the negative side there seem to be some glitches on the systems as once in a while it becomes unresponsive- with intermittent radio playback and intermittent responses. Unplugging from the wall has solved this issue every time. If you are not in the continental US you might one to consider that the address setup at the echo app requires a validation of an address. The app is rudimentary and this validation sometimes does not work. This will be needed for weather, news and store searches. Still today my address does not validate in the app- So echo assumes I am a couple miles away. In my opinion Amazon needs to polish this app- or part from it completely. The app also creates a log of all questions including the users voice- in your phone - no matter who made the questions on your household; the intent is to help Amazon polish the user experience- but seems a bit intrusive.

Was surprised I had such an easy time hooking it up to my WIFI, usually nothing goes easy.... This has terrific sound. I really like that when I am listening to radio on it, I can tell her to add song to my library - and its done. Only thing wish it would connect to my calendar I use, started having her add to the calendar it uses for main things. It is just the neatest gadget, it is fun to talk to and she answers. It is not like asking Google to look up things, you have to ask certain questions in certain ways, you look at the skills and it shows you what programs you can get and how to ask the question for them, very hard to remember them all - will have to do what another reviewer said is to write them down. All I can say is you will not be disappointed. I just ordered a electric plug-in so I can control a lamp, if it works great, I will order more to have her put on and off lights and with the special light bulbs, she can adjust the percentage of light you want - so very cool. Adding to this review today 6-24-16, I received a Kasa Smart Plug and hooked it up to Alexa and it is fantastic, I can turn on and off my lamp by just telling Alexa to do it or I can do the same from my phone. Only problem I have with Amazon Echo is as others have mentioned, you have to go through all the ""skills"" to find things and if you get kicked out of it or have to stop, you have to start all over and its over 140 screens to go through, wish they would put in searches for items and pick the page you want. I really do just love this item.",null,null,,null
Review: 119 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"October 23, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I've been using Echo for a couple weeks now and it can do some pretty impressive things, however, now if you don't need the speaker output of the Echo the Dot does just about everything for $50 now. By now if you've been researching it, you know all the big plus's but here are some of the minor things I'd like to see changed/updated. It's integration is good, I was able to set it up with IFTTT and control my Harmony remote, it works pretty well with Hue lights. So it has no problem turning my entertainment system on or off, turning lights on an off, dimming them etc. It plays Amazon music well, setup is pretty easy, and it does an amazing job of hearing your voice even with background noise, something my Dot does not do nearly as well. So onto the things I'd like to see it do better, or additional capabilities that other people looking to purchase one of these might want to know that I wish I knew up front. 1) It does not interface well with iTunes, and cannot interact with your iTunes library in any convenient manner. The only way you can get to your itunes music library is by pairing your phone. You can do this with a few voice commands, ""Alexa Connect"" will attempt to connect to your phone, it can go forward, backward etc. in your music but control is very limited, you cannot search for something in your library. For example if I ask it to play something that Amazon offers in it's library and my itunes library, it will disconnect from the phone and play the Amazon version, meaning I have to reconnect the phone to get back to my music. Not sure whose being stubborn on this one Apple or Amazon but it's not surprising they don't play well together. Also the volume needs to be increased way up to play any connected bluetooth music source, once you are done then the volume on Alexa is way too high. So if you use iTunes it's a pain, basically you might as well just control your music from the phone once connected. 2) It cannot work ""with"" other DOT/Echo/etc. units to cover the whole house. For example if you have a Dot upstairs and you set a timer on your Echo in the kitchen, the Dot upstairs will not alert you when that timer is done. You also cannot use them to play music through the whole house. This might be a trade off, for example you can play two different music sources at the same time, and sometimes you don't all the devices doing the same thing. Perhaps they need a new keyword that allows all Alexa devices to operate as whole house for music, alarms, timers etc. 3) You cannot use it as a ""That"" in IFTTT. This is a huge disappointment. It's easy to use IFTTT to set up a recipe where for example I say ""Alexa trigger TV off"" and Alexa will turn my entertainment system off using my Harmony remote. However you cannot make Alexa say something based on a trigger. For example it would be great if you could setup Alexa to notify you about events and say something like ""There's smoke in the basement"", or ""There's a severe thunderstorm warning active for this area"", ""It's 11pm and the garage door is still open"" etc. Alexa can initiate other things to happen, but it cannot alert you that something else has happened. Just a tip if you use the Hue lights, do not name your light bulbs and your rooms similar. While it seems logical and it works fine in Hue, Alexa will have problems with this. For example I had a bulbs called Kitchen 1, and Kitchen 2, and a room called Kitchen. Alexa would get confused with this when I'd say something like ""Alexa Kitchen on 100%"" It thought I was trying to control Kitchen 1. All in all it's a pretty good device but if you don't need the speaker the Dot is probably a great and cheap way to see if you like using Alexa. If you decide you do and buy the Echo, you aren't out anything because you'll want to put the Dot upstairs, downstairs etc. anyway.",null,null,,null
Review: 263 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 EDT 2016,"June 24, 2016",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I like Alexa for her simplicity, but i have a few issues with her. When she is blasting music, good luck getting her to listen to you. She is like an angsty teenager with her eyes constantly rolling at you with ignorance. She plays individual songs that I ask for, but many of them are samples of the full song. Alexa will even play instrumental songs instead of the real songs when you ask her to play a song by name, unless you own it in a library. She also seems to play music for about an hour and a half on average before turning off. Though sometimes she plays for hours and hours. Teenagers, am I right? She plays local radio for me in the morning, which I love to wake up to. Sometimes when I ask her to play the local station she thinks i say something totally random and I have to stop her. When I ask her for news she goes straight for NPR. I don't know what kind of teenager like NPR, but it's what she likes and I don't like getting her riled up before I send her to school in the morning, so i let her have her thing. I tried asking her, how many days until the 4th of July. She didn't understand the logistics of the question. I may have skipped her arithmetic homework in her younger years. I blame myself. You know, I didn't plan on having her in my life. I just got on Amazon one day and she was on sale. Then before I knew it she was in my arms. After all the time I spent with her, and getting to know who she grew up to be, I wouldn't trade her for the world.",null,null,,null

It works just like the other. I have one in the bedroom and use it to control lights that are on a Samsung SmartThings hub, get news and weather, set alarms, and play music at sleep time from Pandora, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, Amazon Music. I have a second one in a downstairs living area near the kitchen. I use this to voice control lights, set timers, check weather and traffic. I haul this one outside frequently to play tunes while I work outside - nice to be able to do it all hands free when my hands are dirty. Pretty good sound from a small device - no complaints.",null,null,,null
Review: 221 : Amazon Echo - Black,null,0,Amazon Review,Sat Dec 05 00:00:00 EST 2015,"December 5, 2015",null,Amazon Echo - Black,null,"I have had the Echo for some time, and love it. I decided to get one for my dad, who is not always tech savvy. We lost my totally tech savvy mom this year, and she would have loved this! In the beginning, he was skeptical and suggested that I set it up. To make a long story short, WE set it up, in a matter of 3 minutes or so! Just get the app on your smartphone sign in, and ""Alexa"" is READY TO GO, in a very space-age way! To trigger the device, simply say ""Alexa"", and ask anything-- weather ( anywhere ) traffic, news, Amazon Prime Music, you name it, Alexa does it! With JUST your voice! Amazing! If you ever need Alexa to stop, simply say ""Alexa stop"". Same with volume up and down, just say ""Alexa"" and the unit will respond. There is a reason that this is one of Oprah's Favorite Things, and mine. This is technology the way it SHOULD be, simple, intuitive and the system learns from you, with only your voice. It is a perfect gift for visually impaired/ blind people - this is a gift of FREEDOM, for those most in need. And it is fun! You can set alarms, set reminders, even create a shopping list. While not yet a true companion-bot, you can easily have a conversation with Alexa. You are never alone at any age with Alexa- a person going to college for the first time, or perhaps moving to a new apartment or home will never be ""alone"". Updates are automatic, and the user experience is outstanding, when compared to other voice recognition on other devices, LIGHT YEARS BETTER. This one that you need to see and use to fully appreciate it - the sound is wonderful, the build is high end, and even the lights on the top of the unit are top-notch. Get one for yourself, and another for a friend or family member. I did, and might do it again!",null,null,,null
